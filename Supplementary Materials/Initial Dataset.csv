** WATCH: Dutch farmers clog roads with tractors & machinery over ... **

“Last year you didn’t hear anything about nitrogen, and now suddenly it’s a mortal question,” farmer Micha Bouwer of the Farmers Defence Force told state broadcaster NOS. “These are all people in the city who have two plants on their balcony and say ‘nature is suffering’.”

While livestock farming is among the chief causes of nitrogen pollution, the farmers say they are being disproportionately blamed for climate change, and that their crucial role in food production is being overlooked.
The protest campaign follows Dutch court rulings that the government has an obligation to cut greenhouse emissions more significantly “in order to protect the life and family life of citizens” in the country.  
Dutch politicians are reportedly considering imposing new restrictions on food production and farming in an effort to drastically cut nitrogen output, in opposition to concern from farmers and farming groups.

Prime Minister Mark Rutte warned the protesters on Wednesday that they are entitled to demonstrate but “must follow the rules of the authorities.”
“If you don’t do that, you are in violation and the criminal law applies.”

** Swedish school under fire for forcing kids to take part in climate strike **

* https://www.rt.com/news/469919-children-forced-participate-climate-strike/ *

Västangård school in Umeå, Sweden, notified parents and guardians that participation in last Friday’s climate strike was mandatory.
According to local media, some school principals in Sweden have given approval for students to step out and attend the climate strike, once their permission was sought. However, the school in Umeå said that its students must take part in the movement, regardless of if they’d asked to or not. 
The decision has been criticised by Swedes on Twitter as undemocratic and authoritarian for forcing children to take part in a movement even if they don’t wish to. Local councillor Anders Ågren said in a tweet that parents were told that the school had made the decision at the request of Thunberg. 
The teenager, who has herself been ‘on strike’ from school every Friday for a year, called on young people around the world to skip school for global protests in September to urge leaders to take action on climate change.
Climate strike participation by pupils is reportedly not supported by the teaching unions in Sweden, who say the key to tackling the climate issue is education.

** First it was the cow farts, now asthmatic patients are killing the ... **

* https://www.rt.com/uk/472187-asthma-inhalers-climate-change/ *

Of the 50 million inhalers prescribed in the UK in 2017 for the roughly five million asthmatic patients, seven out of ten emitted the greenhouse gas hydrofluoroalkane, which is used as a propellant to deliver the medicine into the lungs.
A new report by a Cambridge University team suggests that switching to a different type of inhaler could be as big for the environment as becoming vegetarian or committing to fervent recycling, though patients should check with their doctor before making the switch. 
So-called ‘metered-dose inhalers’ account for 4% of the NHS’ greenhouse gas emissions and the researchers suggest that replacing just one in ten of these inhalers with the dry powder kind would reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 58 kilotonnes, the equivalent of 180,000 car journeys from London to Edinburgh.
On an individual level, they argue, it would be the same as cutting meat from your diet altogether, saving the Earth from between 150 and 400kg of carbon dioxide. 
Unsurprisingly, the report was met with outrage online. Many criticized the targeting of people with a chronic and potentially life-threatening illness in the same way multinational corporations are targeted.
Dry powder inhalers are bloody hard to use when you are shaking and cant breathe. This is stopping disabled people using plastic straws all over again.https://t.co/Ymjazsk0aG
“Oh good, now we’re going after asthma patients and asking them to change their inhalers to ‘save the planet’” wrote one irate Twitter user, in a sentiment shared by many.
“No. I’m not switching. Because I’m asthmatic, I don’t use hairspray, aerosol deodorant, or other aerosol sprays. That’s me saving the environment. Until everyone else does everything they can to prevent #ClimateChange I’m not changing inhalers,” came another response.
“The reason people use gas inhalers instead of dry powder is because you may not have the f-ing strength to take your life saving meds otherwise,” another person pointed out.
Some were rather more pointed in their remarks. “All just f**king DIE SHALL WE,” one commenter asked. While another said: “Oh sorry I was born with s**t lungs and need those meds.”
Though a select few met the news with pithy, acerbic wit: “Holding my breath will no doubt help too.”

** A 'woke' remake of 'Baby It's Cold Outside': What's next, a climate ... **

* https://www.rt.com/usa/472141-john-legend-baby-cold-outside/ *

“Baby It’s Cold Outside,” first recorded in 1944, has been covered by many a celebrity duet since – until it ran into the #MeToo minefield last year, and got canceled because some people complained very loudly on social media that its lyrics were about “date rape.” Or as CNN chose to phrase it, “some observed that aspects of the original song were a bit problematic when viewed through a modern lens.” 
Legend rode to the rescue, recording a remake of the song with Kelly Clarkson that re-framed the “rapey” lyrics with what seems like a celebration of alcoholism instead, using language commonly employed to champion abortions:
What will my friends think...(I think they should rejoice.)...if I have one more drink? (It’s your body, and your choice.)
Little else is known about the new version. Though recorded in response to last year’s ban, the song isn’t out yet. Legend previewed it to Vanity Fair over the course of a cover story fawning over his “resistance” activism, among other things (it was the magazine’s special“impeachment edition”). 
If comments on CNN’s report were anything to go by, literally nobody asked for a remake of a song that had been played for 70 years, and was good enough for Rod Stewart and Dolly Parton; Ray Charles and Betty Carter; and Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, among others.
“The entirety of human civilization is problematic when viewed through a modern lens,” said one comment. “Literally none of the aspects of that song are problematic unless you twist them and make them out to be,” said another.
Someone even quoted a passage from George Orwell’s 1984, about how “nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.”
Meanwhile, the culture war madness has made it impossible to tell whether the person who said a reference to climate change “would have finished it off nicely” was joking or being serious.
A lot of art created in the 1940s is considered ‘problematic’ by culture crusaders today, whether because of the ubiquitous use of tobacco, male-female relations, ‘racism’ or any number of other things. Yet it was a product of that age, and reflected the culture and customs of the time. Trying to ‘remake’ any of it to fit a world of cell phones, postmodernism and intersectionality is a recipe for disaster. 
Yet the present-day celebrity artists insist on bowdlerizing the classics instead of creating their own fresh art, properly grounded in their ‘woke’ sensibilities – almost as if they were incapable of actually doing so.

** 'She is kind, but emotions should not control this issue': Putin takes ... **

* https://www.rt.com/news/470070-vladimir-putin-greta-thunberg/ *

Thunberg’s passionate speech before world leaders at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York last week cemented her as probably the world’s most famous climate change activist and media darling. 
“How dare you!,” the 16-year-old campaigner scolded world leaders. “We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money, and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.”

Thunberg’s lecture earned her praise from politicians and the media, but Russian President Vladimir Putin is not among them.
“I may disappoint you but I don’t share the common excitement about the speech by Greta Thunberg,” he told an energy forum in Moscow on Wednesday.
“No one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and ... people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden,” he continued. 
Of course, emotions are inevitable, but still if we want to be effective, we must stay professional.
Thunberg’s eco-activism has been criticized before for focusing on the Western world, while ignoring the damage being done to the environment by less wealthy countries going through their own industrial revolutions.
While young environmentalists should be supported, “when someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned,” the leader argued.

“I’m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl,” Putin added.
“But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.”
While Thunberg’s solitary school walkout last year has since evolved into thousands-strong ‘Fridays for Future’ protests worldwide, her activism has drawn criticism for its apparent alarmism, as well as mockery from US President Donald Trump. Thunberg herself has said that this backlash proves her message is “too loud to handle.”
Yet, critics also pointed out that the teenager has failed to present any clear steps on how to change the situation.

** The REAL inconvenient truth: Polar bears thriving in spite of climate ... **

* https://www.rt.com/op-ed/473160-scientist-fired-polar-bears-starving-not-climate-change/ *

Zoologist and polar bear expert Susan Crockford was shunned by the academy for her insistence that despite the polar bear’s status as a climate change icon, the warming planet had actually caused the species to thrive. She did not deny climate change – merely the idea that it was harming the bears.
After losing her contract as an adjunct professor at Canada’s University of Victoria, where she worked for 15 years, she has been vindicated by a report from northern Canada confirming her theory that polar bears are climate change’s beneficiaries, rather than its victims.
Footage of an emaciated polar bear, captioned “this is what climate change looks like,” yanked at the world’s heartstrings when it was posted on National Geographic in 2017. Eight months later, the publication changed the caption to “this is what starvation looks like,” admitting there was no way to tell why the bear was starving. But it wasn’t the first sick bear to be pressed into service for the environmentalist cause, and it won’t be the last. Climate change’s PR team may have made an unfortunate choice in elevating the polar bear to icon status.
The Inuit groups who actually live with the bears in northern Canada seem to agree with Crockford's claim that bear populations are increasing, as documented in a court affidavit by the director of wildlife management for the Nunavik Marine Region Wildlife Board. Faced with cuts to their bear-hunting quota by an environment ministry concerned with population numbers, Nunavut residents have seen an “increase in the polar bear population and a particularly notable increase since the 1980s,” the director attested.
Nor are the (plentiful) bears suffering or sickly: “Nunavik Inuit report that it is rare to see a skinny bear and most bears are observed to be healthy,” the affidavit continued. Locals are, however, reportedly concerned about outside perception of declining polar bear numbers, fueled by groups like the World Wildlife Federation (WWF), which explicitly described the bears as the “poster child for the impacts of climate change on species.”
Crockford has been saying for years that bear populations are either growing or stable – even though they may go down in some habitats, they increase in others. She does say starvation is the most common cause of death for adult bears, but there are many factors that could lead them to the state captured by National Geographic – from too many bears, straining food supplies and leaving slower hunters out-competed; to broken jaws, other injuries, and disease. 
But as ice cover decreases, she claims, polar bears thrive. The ringed seals that are one of their primary food sources multiply in the warmer water, and polar bear populations have been steady or on the rise since 2005, all predictions of doom aside.
Polar bear populations hit record highs in 2018, Crockford revealed in last year’s State of the Polar Bear report, whose publication by the climate skeptic Global Warming Policy Foundation was sparsely noted outside fellow-traveler sites like Climate Depot. Despite sea ice depletion to levels not expected until 2050, which was supposed to decimate two thirds of the bear population, the animals are thriving.
In fact, they’re thriving too much, according to the humans who have to live with them. The Nunavut government sounded the alarm last year: “Inuit believe there are now so many bears that public safety has become a major concern… the polar bear may have exceeded the coexistence threshold.” Two locals were killed in bear attacks in the region. Nor is Canada the only habitat affected – in 2017, they laid siege to the Siberian town of Ryrkaypiy, invading human homes and terrifying the locals. 
Even the WWF has softened its predictions of a polar bear apocalypse, admitting that only one of the 19 bear populations are in decline as of 2017 while two are increasing and seven are stable. Yet the International Union for Conservation of Nature insists the numbers will plummet 30 percent by 2050, linking population decline with dwindling sea ice. 
Crockford’s view – even though it’s based on years of research and previous studies – is considered heretical and scorned by climate doomsayers, for whom no deviation from orthodoxy is permitted, even when the facts do not match the propaganda.
The University of Victoria declined to renew her contract in May this year after 15 years of employment despite having promoted her work in the past. The school’s speakers’ bureau, which had sent her out for ten years to give lectures to schools and adult groups, dropped her like a hot potato in May 2017 after a vague outside complaint about her “lack of balance” allegedly triggered a kafkaesque cascade of deplatforming culminating in her removal. The school did not deny the reason she was let go was because of her heretical polar bear science, but would not confirm it either.
Misrepresenting thriving wildlife populations as a harbinger of their doom is nothing new for nature photographers and documentarians – David Attenborough’s depiction of suicidal walruses plummeting from cliffs “because of climate change” was recently exposed as less than the whole truth.
Walruses ‘hauled out’ on land are spooked easily and will plummet from cliffs in their rush to return to the safety of the water. These stampedes can be triggered by polar bears, who do so deliberately in order to feast on the dead walruses left trampled or smashed at the cliff bottom, or by overhead planes (or the drones used for documentary filming).
One of the most notorious examples of phony wildlife tragedy gave rise to the myth of suicidal, cliff-jumping lemmings. A 1958 Disney nature documentary captured the little creatures marching off a precipice, seemingly to their doom, teaching viewers a valuable lesson about blindly following a leader, but that scene was staged by the filmmakers for the sake of added drama. 
Climate change proponents may not be staging mass animal suicide to convince the public, but their effort to torpedo the career of a scientist for reasons unrelated to the integrity of her research is equally unprofessional. The climate change debate must be had in good faith by scientific professionals on all sides, with participants free to voice their research-based dissent with prevailing orthodoxy, or it is not science but doctrine.

** Kyoto failed. Paris failed. Will the Greta-starring Madrid UN climate ... **

* https://www.rt.com/op-ed/474749-cop25-un-climate-change-thunberg/ *

Rob Lyons is a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panic on a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'.
Rob Lyons is a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panic on a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'.
Starting on Monday, COP25, or the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to give the summit its full name, will bring together top officials from 197 countries with the aim of establishing a set of new national targets towards cutting emissions. The talks were originally due to be held in Brazil, but the government there pulled out 12 months ago. Chile offered to take over but, after weeks of street protests, the government there pulled out, too. Finally, the Spanish government stepped in four weeks ago to take over.
The talks will review the progress made since the much-ballyhooed Paris Agreement was signed at COP21 in December 2015. The Agreement aims to reduce emissions enough to keep global temperature rises 'well below' two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and ideally 1.5 degrees. The world has already warmed by about one degree Celsius from that baseline, leaving nations with even less leeway.
Each country has promised to set a national goal for lowering emissions along with a plan for how that might be achieved. 

There were two main problems with the Paris Agreement. First, there is no international mechanism to enforce the targets that countries declare. Beyond domestic laws and 'peer pressure' from other countries, there is no penalty for failure. Second, the cuts pledged so far are nowhere near sufficient, if climate models are correct, to stop the world warming by well over two degrees. Hence the demand for new, even more ambitious targets to be set, both in Madrid and at the 2020 meeting in Glasgow, UK.
Countries do seem to be stepping up their ambitions – or, at least, their rhetoric. For example, more and more countries are pledging to reach 'net zero' emissions by 2050 or shortly after. In the past few days, the new president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has demanded that EU member states commit to cutting emissions by 55 percent by 2030.
The record on achieving emissions cuts in this way is very poor. For all the grand declarations at UN events, the reality is that even the weak targets set so far have only been met by accident rather than by design. 
For example, the Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, committed industrialized countries to cut overall emissions by five percent, compared to 1990, by 2012. The targets were just about met – but mainly because of the deindustrialization of Eastern Europe and Russia after 1990, along with unrelated events in Western countries, namely the economic crisis of 2008-09.
The scale of the problem is highlighted by the UN Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report 2019, published on 26 November. The report analyses the 'emissions gap' between what is currently happening, what countries have pledged to do and the emissions reductions that are needed. In short, far from emissions falling rapidly or even stabilizing, they have carried on rising at about 1.5 percent per year. 
That also means that the cuts that are needed to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement must be made even faster.
At which point, it is surely worth asking: is the problem a lack of political will, as many critics maintain, or is the whole process of setting targets simply wrong? When faced with the problem of maintaining or improving living standards for their own citizens, governments' first thought will always be to protect their own position rather than make cutbacks. 
And Emmanuel Macron’s desire to go against his people with a fuel tax a year ago – which provoked a year of Yellow Vest protests – shows the political costs of the elite trying to impose its green policies on a reluctant electorate.
In truth, the West has barely recovered from the crash of 2008. Politicians are highly unlikely to jeopardize what little growth is happening by imposing more taxes and restrictions on pollution. 
Even when the politicians do manage to squeeze policies through, they are highly cost-inefficient. Germany has spent over €300 billion ($330.5 bn) on introducing renewables like wind power and solar power, yet they make up just one-seventh of Germany's energy needs and German consumers now pay the highest electricity prices in Europe.
There is, if we stop predicting doom and put our faith into human ingenuity instead. For one thing, there is no 'climate emergency.' We should ignore the advice of Greta Thunberg to 'panic.' These claims are an attempt to silence dissent and debate, to force us to do what the eco-warriors want rather than take a balanced view.
1. Don't panic!
The world is likely to get warmer, whatever we do. But thanks to economic development - mostly powered by fossil fuels - we are in a better position to deal with whatever nature throws at us. Just one example: deaths from natural disasters have plummeted in the past century thanks to better transport, communications, healthcare and food supplies. We need more economic growth so we may drag billions more out of poverty and be even more resilient in the future.
2. Apply the best technologies – and develop even better ones
Let's pick the 'low-hanging fruit' – the easiest and cheapest ways to cut emissions. For example, low-energy lighting both cuts energy use and saves money very quickly. Switching from coal to gas for electricity generation has been successful in the UK and US. Alongside that, let's invest in things that are good ideas in themselves, but also happen to cut emissions, so-called 'no regrets' policies. Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles not only don't produce greenhouse gas emissions, but can drastically improve the air in our cities - and they need less maintenance, too. Let's strive to make them cheaper and more reliable.
3. Stop wasting money on renewables
Wind and solar can be useful if the conditions are right - where there's lots of sunshine or plenty of wind. Otherwise, they don't cut emissions by much and they are not reliable, but they do increase the cost of energy. We need reliable, affordable forms of low-carbon energy, whether it is existing technology like nuclear fission or new possibilities like nuclear fusion. Let's use some of the money we save on renewables to launch a new wave of energy research.
Some of these things will take time to come to fruition. But we must take the long term view – which is exactly what the green activists always demand. So instead of quick headline-grabbing but meaningless fixes to stave off the apocalypse, we must trust ourselves to work our way out. Not that you will hear much of that optimistic rhetoric in Madrid.

Rob Lyons is a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panic on a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'.
Rob Lyons is a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panic on a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'.
UK medical journal The Lancet has just published a familiar, downbeat assessment of the future of climate change and human health. The latest edition of its Countdown on Health and Climate Change, an annual analysis that tracks progress across 41 key indicators, examines the impact on human health if the world either takes action to meet the Paris Agreement targets or continues with 'business as usual'.
The project is a collaboration between 120 experts from 35 institutions including the World Health Organisation (WHO), World Bank, University College London, and Tsinghua University in China.
The 2019 analysis claims that if the world sticks to 'business as usual' policies rather than making concerted efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 'net zero' by 2050, the effects on human health could be serious. Infants will be the most vulnerable to malnutrition, rising food prices and infectious diseases, particularly pathogens that cause diarrhea and wound infections, which can affect wide areas as temperatures rise.
According to the report, air pollution contributes to 20,500 deaths per year in the UK alone. The costs of air pollution across Europe could reach €129 billion per year if pollution levels remain high.
Extreme temperatures will become a greater problem, too. In 2018, the number of elderly people exposed to heatwaves rose by 220 million compared with 2000, with older city-dwellers in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean most vulnerable.
In conclusion, the authors argue that urgent action is required to meet the Paris Agreement targets.
""This year, the accelerating impacts of climate change have become clearer than ever. The highest recorded temperatures in Western Europe and wildfires in Siberia, Queensland, and California triggered asthma, respiratory infections and heat stroke. Sea levels are now rising at an ever concerning rate,"" said Professor Hugh Montgomery, co-chair of The Lancet Countdown and director of the Institute for Human Health and Performance at University College London.
Professor Montgomery sees the school strikes led by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as an inspiration. ""Our children recognise this climate emergency and demand action to protect them. We must listen, and respond.""
However, before we all sink into depression, some caution is needed. First, the report's idea of ""business as usual"" seems particularly gloomy, even alarmist, by assuming a rise of global temperatures of between four and seven degrees Celsius by the end of the century, compared to pre-industrial temperatures. Since we've had one degree of warming already, that means at least three degrees more in the next 80 years. However, that would be double the rate of global warming over the past 40 years. While anything is possible, that's a very important and significant assumption.
Moreover, it has been a problem noted for some time that the climate models such forecasts are based on have been ""running hot"" - that is, they overestimate temperature rises. As a result, the claims about health in this report, based on large temperature rises, are almost certainly excessively gloomy. 
Indeed, rather than start from what might happen in the future, perhaps it is better to examine what we actually know about - what has happened in the past few decades. Here, the report offers much happier news.
All-cause mortality is falling around the world. In fact, it's the reason why the world's population is growing. We're not having more children, we're all just living longer. As Our World in Data notes, when it comes to health, ""the world has made rapid progress. Today most people in the world can expect to live as long as those in the very richest countries in 1950. Today’s global average life expectancy of 71 years is higher than that of any country in 1950 with the exception of a handful in Northern Europe.""
There has been particular progress in relation to deaths from malaria, a disease that particularly blights Africa. The Lancet report shows that deaths from malaria have fallen very sharply in the twenty-first century. Our World in Data notes World Health Organization figures that suggest that in the first 15 years of this century, ""the global death toll has been cut in half: from 839,000 deaths in 2000 to 438,000 in 2015.""
The policies promoted by the Lancet report to prevent health risks from climate change mean a rapid cut in the use of fossil fuels. But many of the great improvements in human health in recent decades have been possible thanks to economic development powered by fossil fuels. 
Simply phasing out oil, coal and gas without reliable and affordable alternatives will cause more problems than it solves. Rich countries have great difficulty in integrating wind and solar power, for example, which are unreliable or intermittent - or both. How could poorer countries possibly rely on them?
Moreover, some problems mentioned in the report could be dealt with in a way that doesn't demand a cut in greenhouse-gas emissions. For example, we can cut deaths from air pollution by switching from dirty, polluting cars to cleaner, more modern models. We can keep coal-powered electricity generation away from major centres of population, or switch from coal to gas, as many countries have been doing.
We also need to take note of the potential improvements in health as a result of climate change. Reports like the one by the Lancet have a tendency to focus on costs, but rarely mention benefits. But if we leave out those benefits, we can't produce sensible policies for the future.
For example, if the world is getting warmer, there may be more deaths from heat (though that is not certain), but there may also be fewer deaths from cold. In fact, cold weather is much more likely to be a cause of death than extreme heat. This is another reason to be cautious about cutting the use of fossil fuels: if we make energy more expensive, we could end up costing lives as poorer people fail to heat their homes sufficiently.
In recent years, the Lancet has become more famous for its campaigns than for sober analysis of medical issues. This new report is typical of that attitude. The report's claims and conclusions deserve far greater scrutiny and skepticism than most of the mainstream media will provide.

An interview with Jeremy Clarkson by The Independent was never going to be a friendly exchange. Clarkson has built a career out of mocking the social justice proclamations of the liberal newspaper’s bedfellows, and the Independent unloaded a woke broadside at the ‘Grand Tour’ host the moment he swaggered into the room.
Describing the show as “schoolboy sniggering from a trio who have drawn much criticism over the years for encouraging toxic masculinity and cracking colonial-style jokes,” the Independent went on to suggest that “the public is finally tiring of his schtick,” and noted that it’s “tough to justify” a car show in 2019, when the European Parliament has declared a “climate and environment emergency.”
Clarkson is no less conciliatory, calling the interviewers “snowflakes,” and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg a “stupid idiot” and a “weird Swede with a bad temper.”
Rather than deny climate change, Clarkson suggested that the legions of Thunberg-inspired ‘school strikers’ should stay in the classroom and pay attention to their science lessons, rather than hopping on a “carbon fibre yacht” and going to “shout at Donald Trump.”
Indeed, Clarkson seems to have pulled a u-turn on the environment of late. An upcoming feature-length episode of The Grand Tour deals with the consequences of climate change on Vietnam’s rivers, and the avid petrolhead has recently embraced life in the slow lane, taking up farming in Oxfordshire. He says this operation is “completely carbon neutral,” and soaks up the emissions his collection of sports cars generates.
Gaining no traction on the environmental front, the Independent’s hit-squad of woke scribes switched tactics, calling Clarkson “toxically masculine.” 
An angry, toxic, irrelevant older man is intimidated by a young, intelligent, articulate female who can understand climate science. Nothing new here. Next. #ClimateCrisishttps://t.co/ebmU7hPjqZ
“You’ve perhaps mistaken me for someone who could do something about these things,” he responded, adding “I’m 60 - it’s not my job to be woke, it’s my job to die soon.”
A pointless interview where neither side learned anything from the other? Very 2019. But there’s one thing the interviewers can’t grasp: Clarkson still speaks for the masses. 
The rumble of a V8 engine, the scream of a Ferrari at full pelt, the smell of petrol and burning rubber still awaken something primal and sensory in us. Internal combustion still stirs the emotions in a way that whirring electric motors and soulless public transport cannot.
Independent journalists, city-dwelling environmentalists, and Brussels bureaucrats may cheer the twilight of the car as we know it, but most regular folk don’t. That’s the appeal of Clarkson and shows like ‘The Grand Tour.’ In an age when fuel prices are rising and carbon taxes - not to mention to pervasive shaming of the mainstream media - are chipping away at the regular schlub’s hopes of ever owning a sports car of their own, Clarkson’s TV shows are pure escapism.
The first episode of the latest season of ‘Top Gear’ - hosted by Clarkson for 25 years - was the highest-rated launch episode of the show since 2016, and the most-watched BBC Two title of 2019 so far. On YouTube, car channels like Mighty Car Mods, Jay Leno’s Garage, Regular Car Reviews and Doug DeMuro have amassed millions of subscribers. 
The car community is thriving, despite the Independent declaring “the end of the road for Clarkson and his pals.”
Even if his comments are groan-inducing at times, figures like Clarkson also provide a foil for social justice crusaders like The Independent’s interviewers, who have brought concepts like ‘toxic masculinity’ out of social sciences departments and feminist bookstores, and into the mainstream.
In the face of such relentless joylessness, Clarkson may not be the hero we need, but he is the hero we’re stuck with.

Edward Felsenthal, the editor-in-chief of TIME boasted that 16-year-old Greta Thunberg is the magazine’s youngest choice to be named Person of the Year.
I was not the least bit surprised – by now it would have been an upset if the headline-making environmentalist failed to reap yet another publicity reward  – but still alarmed.
Gone are the days when TIME chose adult men, like Martin Luther King or Winston Churchill as the magazine’s person of the year (Adolf Hitler too – the award is for the most influential, not necessarily the most virtuous public figure).
These days the accent is on youth, and Greta Thunberg personifies the much acclaimed ‘wisdom of the child’. That is why three Norwegian MPs nominated Thunberg for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.
The transformation of a teen schoolgirl into the global conscience for climate change is driven by the imperative of reversing the relationship between adults and children.
Throughout the Western world the authority of adulthood is in crisis. Adulthood is increasingly associated with negative attributes and grown ups feel less and less able to provide guidance to young people. The flip side of the erosion of adult authority is the tendency to look to young people for solutions and answers. That is why Western society’s depreciation of adulthood coexists with adulation of the supposed wisdom of children.
Arguably the most grotesque manifestation of this trend is the spectacle of politicians and dignitaries intently listening to Greta at high profile international meetings. A thunderous standing ovation is guaranteed by the mere appearance of this symbol of an infantilised political culture.
In making her TIME magazine’s Person of the Year or offering her a platform at a meeting of world leaders, children are in effect invited to condemn the older generation. And Greta has been more than ready to rise to the occasion. The theme of adult irresponsibility has been her most common refrain – appearing in her lecture to the United Nations climate change summit as far back as a year ago, and in every major speech she has made this year.
“Since our leaders are behaving like children, we will have to take the responsibility they should have taken long ago,” she said last December. “We have to understand what the older generation has dealt to us, what mess they have created that we have to clean up and live with.”
Green demonstrators have readily embraced the narrative of adult guilt. Posters declaring, ‘You’ll Die of Old Age, We’ll Die of Climate Change’ or ‘I Am Ditching School Because You Are Ditching Our Future’ point the finger of blame at slothful adults who are supposedly responsible for the imminent early deaths of their offspring. Recently, a placard screaming ‘Adults Ruin Everything. Stop Brexit’ at an anti-Brexit demonstration indicated that the spirit of adult blaming is not confined to the problem of planetary destruction.
Encouraging children to revolt against their irresponsible elders is the inevitable outcome of adult-blaming. That is why the head of politics at Cambridge University could call for children as young as six to be given the vote. Professor David Runciman advocated this proposal on the grounds that young people were “massively outnumbered” by the elderly and that this created a democratic crisis that had to be put right.
 
You know that society is in deep trouble when six-year-olds are assigned the responsibility for determining society’s future – but this is not just about battle lines being drawn up according to generational divides.
Greta and other unspoilt youth idols provide cover for the anything-but-innocent elites, who can hide that they lack the courage of their convictions, or the ability to get others to follow them behind the fiery rhetoric of youth.
Who needs grown ups to lead the nation when children are ready to put right the mistakes created by old people? But that might not be quite the optimistic sentiment it is presented as.

** Greta's growing up and now liberal eco-warriors and the media face ... **

* https://www.rt.com/op-ed/474979-greta-thunberg-madrid-climate/ *

Anyone with a teenager at home knows how unreasonable and unexpected their moments of rage can be, firing off emotional missiles at the closest targets oblivious to the consequences and instantly forgetful of the motives for their attack.
And so we have Greta Thunberg.
Backed by liberals, eco-warriors, and the plainly exploitative, the Swedish teenager has become a talisman for the climate change brigade who, while loving the media attention this kid attracts, have failed to equip her with the armour she has needed to deal with what was initially an awestruck media but has now turned into something else.
As she arrived in Lisbon on Tuesday after a trans-Atlantic crossing on a 48-foot (15-metre) catamaran, TV crews filmed her being stage managed by her doting dad and encouraged to wave at the adoring crowds gathered dockside to welcome her on her way to the COP25 yakfest in Madrid, Spain.
The event seemed to lack the spontaneity of an earlier outing, Greta’s spiel seemed well-worn and the welcoming officials seemed kind of weird.
Why grown men dressed in suits and three times her age gathered to shake the hand of the bewildered teenage girl is beyond me, unless of course, it was solely for the photo op, heaven forbid.
After the platitudes to the people of Lisbon, “wonderful place, wonderful people, blah, blah,” Greta continued with her usual schtick of saving the world for our children, our children’s children and “every other living human being.” 
When she declared the sentiment that “we all have to make sure we’re on the right side of history by doing everything we can” the short, off-the-cuff speech began to sound a bit like an amalgam of key soundbites we’d all heard before and from other high profile eco-botherers of recent history, like Al Gore.
Greta says she first heard of climate change when she was eight years old and wondered why more wasn’t being done. That’s the same age most girls are wondering if they will ever see a unicorn and if Santa actually delivers those presents on Christmas Day.
Her opera-singer mum and actor dad, in the best Swedish liberal tradition, indulged their little darling, eschewing meat-eating and air travel at the insistence of their precocious daughter.
The result is Greta 2019.
First it was berating the United Nations on its home turf in New York, fixing Donald Trump with a death stare of which he was blissfully unaware, and now here she is again, lecturing parents everywhere that they should kow-tow to their upset kids.
“If they want us to stop being angry, maybe they should stop making us angry,” she told the pliant press in Lisbon, who had gathered to swallow her every word, when told that some adults considered her “angry.”
And how, my little petal, would us big bad grown-ups manage to do that? Bend to your every whim, tread on eggshells near you when you’re feeling moody in case we do something you disagree with? Most parents will agree, indulgence just breeds spoilt children and while they are funny in some ways for their precociousness, knowing they can play an adult to get what they want, they become unbearable as they get older.
Let’s face it, if young Greta was old Greta sailing round the planet, preaching to us all about the errors of our ways it is highly unlikely that she would be given the media coverage she currently enjoys. She would simply be yet another member of Extinction Rebellion, or Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth protesting outside the Palace of Westminster or Shell HQ or one of the big banks. Bless.
And while the enamoured world’s press dread this ever happening, the day will come in the not too distant future when Greta grows up and people will view her as just another adult and stop paying attention to her earnest outpourings.
Then those who are currently urging her on as some sort of eco-saint will realise that Greta Thunberg’s greatest value is not that she’s well-informed, engaging or even angry. Her selling point is that Greta is a kid.

** Surprise! Greta Thunberg BIOPIC reveals cameras were rolling from ... **

* https://www.rt.com/news/476133-greta-documentary-rise-to-fame/ *

By Helen Buyniski, RT
Thunberg, recently crowned Time magazine’s Person of the Year, can add documentary film subject to her burgeoning resumé. The film, tentatively titled ‘Greta,’ was announced by Deadline on Monday for a 2020 Hulu premiere. Director Nathan Grossman has followed the young climate prodigy to the ends of the Earth, from her school-striking on the sidewalk in front of the Swedish Parliament, to the high seas aboard the $4mn racing yacht Malizia II. Grossman’s only other IMDB credit to date is a Swedish film titled “Köttets lustar” (or “Lusts of the Meat”), which, while it sounds pornographic, purports to be the story of one man “looking over his life as a carnivore.”
One might ask why, if Thunberg’s meteoric rise from her lonely sidewalk protests to hectoring the rulers of the world about her stolen future was as organic as it is presented, a documentary crew was already present to film her sitting alone on the pavement? It’s not like her parents have been trying to make her a celebrity since she was just 12 years old, only to have their exploitative TV show idea rejected by Swedish broadcaster SVT. Never mind, all thatdid happen.
Thunberg’s parents, opera singer Malena Ernman and actor Svante Thunberg, are both famous in their own right, and it’s not difficult to see how their connections might have expedited the process through which Thunberg became the ubiquitous symbol of climate change. Her rise has been meticulously choreographed, her school strike made famous on its first day by Ingmar Rentzhog of the climate change social network ‘We Don’t Have Time.’ Rentzhog, already friends with Thunberg’s parents, has already been accused of using the girl’s image to raise millions of dollars for his company – making her a household name in the process.
A year later, her larger-than-life image graces four stories of a wall in San Francisco, cafeterias in Tel Aviv (where her disapproving gaze is supposed to shame eaters away from plastic utensils), and London’s Trafalgar Square, where an ice sculpture carved in her likeness was raised in October as a teaser for what a trio of “creatives” hope will be a permanent statue of the climate crusader. A colossus bestriding the English Channel can’t be far behind.
There are already signs all is not well in Thunberg’s world, however. Even as hundreds of thousands of people took part in a school strike in Madrid to mark her appearance at the recent climate conference and the EU finally declared a climate emergency last month, solutions lag far behind the declared scale of the problem.
Thunberg herself lamented that a year of school striking has essentially accomplished nothing, emissions-wise – that the planet is no further from certain doom than it was before she began her remarkably successful campaign to shame world leaders into caring. Indeed, as more countries are pushed to declare “climate emergencies” and “do [a never specified] something” to get emissions down to zero yesterday, with no concrete solutions presented, the less likely they are to be able to produce the desired cuts.
Instead, they fall back on magical thinking – carbon offsets, cap and trade, carbon taxes, and other schemes and scams that essentially amount to bribing the climate into staying put – or, more specifically, bribing climate authorities into looking the other way while the polluting continues. Panicking never yields wise decisions, yet global authorities are taking to heart Greta Thunberg’s advice to act as if the house was on fire. If they aren’t careful, it will be.

** Kyoto failed. Paris failed. Will the Greta-starring Madrid UN climate ... **

Rob Lyons is a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panic on a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'.
Rob Lyons is a UK journalist specialising in science, environmental and health issues. He is the author of 'Panic on a Plate: How Society Developed an Eating Disorder'.
Starting on Monday, COP25, or the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to give the summit its full name, will bring together top officials from 197 countries with the aim of establishing a set of new national targets towards cutting emissions. The talks were originally due to be held in Brazil, but the government there pulled out 12 months ago. Chile offered to take over but, after weeks of street protests, the government there pulled out, too. Finally, the Spanish government stepped in four weeks ago to take over.
The talks will review the progress made since the much-ballyhooed Paris Agreement was signed at COP21 in December 2015. The Agreement aims to reduce emissions enough to keep global temperature rises 'well below' two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and ideally 1.5 degrees. The world has already warmed by about one degree Celsius from that baseline, leaving nations with even less leeway.
Each country has promised to set a national goal for lowering emissions along with a plan for how that might be achieved. 

There were two main problems with the Paris Agreement. First, there is no international mechanism to enforce the targets that countries declare. Beyond domestic laws and 'peer pressure' from other countries, there is no penalty for failure. Second, the cuts pledged so far are nowhere near sufficient, if climate models are correct, to stop the world warming by well over two degrees. Hence the demand for new, even more ambitious targets to be set, both in Madrid and at the 2020 meeting in Glasgow, UK.
Countries do seem to be stepping up their ambitions – or, at least, their rhetoric. For example, more and more countries are pledging to reach 'net zero' emissions by 2050 or shortly after. In the past few days, the new president of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has demanded that EU member states commit to cutting emissions by 55 percent by 2030.
The record on achieving emissions cuts in this way is very poor. For all the grand declarations at UN events, the reality is that even the weak targets set so far have only been met by accident rather than by design. 
For example, the Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, committed industrialized countries to cut overall emissions by five percent, compared to 1990, by 2012. The targets were just about met – but mainly because of the deindustrialization of Eastern Europe and Russia after 1990, along with unrelated events in Western countries, namely the economic crisis of 2008-09.
The scale of the problem is highlighted by the UN Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report 2019, published on 26 November. The report analyses the 'emissions gap' between what is currently happening, what countries have pledged to do and the emissions reductions that are needed. In short, far from emissions falling rapidly or even stabilizing, they have carried on rising at about 1.5 percent per year. 
That also means that the cuts that are needed to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement must be made even faster.
At which point, it is surely worth asking: is the problem a lack of political will, as many critics maintain, or is the whole process of setting targets simply wrong? When faced with the problem of maintaining or improving living standards for their own citizens, governments' first thought will always be to protect their own position rather than make cutbacks. 
And Emmanuel Macron’s desire to go against his people with a fuel tax a year ago – which provoked a year of Yellow Vest protests – shows the political costs of the elite trying to impose its green policies on a reluctant electorate.
In truth, the West has barely recovered from the crash of 2008. Politicians are highly unlikely to jeopardize what little growth is happening by imposing more taxes and restrictions on pollution. 
Even when the politicians do manage to squeeze policies through, they are highly cost-inefficient. Germany has spent over €300 billion ($330.5 bn) on introducing renewables like wind power and solar power, yet they make up just one-seventh of Germany's energy needs and German consumers now pay the highest electricity prices in Europe.
There is, if we stop predicting doom and put our faith into human ingenuity instead. For one thing, there is no 'climate emergency.' We should ignore the advice of Greta Thunberg to 'panic.' These claims are an attempt to silence dissent and debate, to force us to do what the eco-warriors want rather than take a balanced view.
1. Don't panic!
The world is likely to get warmer, whatever we do. But thanks to economic development - mostly powered by fossil fuels - we are in a better position to deal with whatever nature throws at us. Just one example: deaths from natural disasters have plummeted in the past century thanks to better transport, communications, healthcare and food supplies. We need more economic growth so we may drag billions more out of poverty and be even more resilient in the future.
2. Apply the best technologies – and develop even better ones
Let's pick the 'low-hanging fruit' – the easiest and cheapest ways to cut emissions. For example, low-energy lighting both cuts energy use and saves money very quickly. Switching from coal to gas for electricity generation has been successful in the UK and US. Alongside that, let's invest in things that are good ideas in themselves, but also happen to cut emissions, so-called 'no regrets' policies. Electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles not only don't produce greenhouse gas emissions, but can drastically improve the air in our cities - and they need less maintenance, too. Let's strive to make them cheaper and more reliable.
3. Stop wasting money on renewables
Wind and solar can be useful if the conditions are right - where there's lots of sunshine or plenty of wind. Otherwise, they don't cut emissions by much and they are not reliable, but they do increase the cost of energy. We need reliable, affordable forms of low-carbon energy, whether it is existing technology like nuclear fission or new possibilities like nuclear fusion. Let's use some of the money we save on renewables to launch a new wave of energy research.
Some of these things will take time to come to fruition. But we must take the long term view – which is exactly what the green activists always demand. So instead of quick headline-grabbing but meaningless fixes to stave off the apocalypse, we must trust ourselves to work our way out. Not that you will hear much of that optimistic rhetoric in Madrid.

** For liberals, it's more fun to blame climate change than arsonists for ... **

* https://www.rt.com/op-ed/477667-climate-change-australia-fires/ *

Nearly 200 people, who have been arrested by police in five of Australia’s seven states since September, are to blame for many of these killer blazes, while the tinder-dry undergrowth and long-term drought have created the perfect conditions which allow the fires to rage.
As a journalist in rural Victoria earlier in my career – decades before climate crisis became a term - I often saw bushfires flare up in the drier months, racing up and down grasslands with incredible speed and sending balls of fire from treetop to treetop. It was a frightening but impressive sight and made for startling photography, even in a black and white newspaper.
So sleepy was the town that my colleagues and I used to joke it could be the firemen starting these fires, just to have something to do.
Incidentally, in November a volunteer firefighter was arrested and charged with seven counts of arson in one Australian state, just as this fire season started.
So maybe there was more truth to that claim than we thought. But troubled souls in that profession are just a small part of what is actually a genuine problem.
Deliberate or suspected arson is to blame for nearly 50 per cent of the blazes (and lightning strikes for another 10), with nearly half of those lit by adolescents. And school holidays are a bad time for bushfires.
Back in late-1980s Australia, farmers and landholders would periodically burn off the undergrowth of dry vegetation in the cooler months, which would reduce the amount of fuel an uncontrolled blaze could access. It was considered the lesser of two evils.
As climate issues came onto the agenda, this type of controlled burning became frowned upon by environmentalists.
The argument goes back and forth over the benefits of prescribed burning, with the green lobby having the upper hand in recent years – arguing in favor of deliberately setting fires makes for poor PR.
And you can’t help but laugh imagining for a second that, instead of blathering valiantly about climate change, Cate Blanchett or Jennifer Aniston would give an impassioned speech about the benefits of controlled burning, or the importance of harsher sentences for arsonists.
Even if those measures could save millions of acres of bush, and thousands of their beloved koalas.

** Cusack, Bernie's prophet of doom: Only 10-12 years to stop climate ... **

* https://www.rt.com/usa/478665-john-cusack-bernie-sanders/ *

Zachary Leeman is the author of the novel Nigh and journalist who covers art and culture.
Introducing Sanders in Exeter, New Hampshire, on Saturday, the 53-year-old actor threw out a doomsday scenario where the world only has a “10 to 12 year window” to reverse the effects of climate change and combat the “predatory capitalism” that is supposedly fueling it.
“The billionaires are getting nervous and all the corporate media is — they hate us, they don’t hate us, they’re confused. And it seems like every conceivable power structure on Earth is trying to kill or derail our movement, but we’re still here,” Cusack announced to the assembled Sanders supporters.
“We know this form of capitalism takes and takes; it takes whatever, whenever, however it wants. It’ll take our lives, it’ll take our labor, our spirit, our air and water, even our earth.”
Cusack: “Bernie respects us enough to tell us the truth, the hard truth: We a have 10-12 year window to radically change our energy systems, climate change, predatory capitalism, and the endless war economies will rob us of the right to any future at all.” pic.twitter.com/C52WjAS3YS
Cusack’s climate change fear-mongering may have played to the crowd of Bernie supporters, but he isn’t flipping many votes, judging by the wider reaction on social media. 
“The self-awareness of @johncusack is undetectable with an electron microscope,” actor and director Nick Searcy tweeted in response to Cusack’s speech.

‘Full Metal Jacket’ actor Adam Baldwin questioned whether Cusack is suggesting war with China with his doomsday prediction, considering the country leads the United States in CO2 emissions.

** Roger Federer issues response after criticism from climate change **

* https://www.rt.com/sport/478034-roger-federer-greta-thunberg-criticism/ *

The hashtag #WakeUpRoger went viral this week following the trial of twelve Swiss activists who staged a demonstration last year by playing tennis in branches of Credit Suisse, highlighting Federer's links with the company. 
The debate was soon stoked on social media, while protesters at the trial carried placards which read, ""Credit Suisse is destroying the planet. Roger, do you support them?"", referencing reports which suggest that Credit Suisse has invested large sums of money in the search for new fossil fuel deposits. The message was then retweeted by Thunberg, further amplifying it. 
In response to Thunberg and to the growing online discontent with his association with the bank, Federer issued a response in which he says that he fully supports young climate activists like Thunberg in their fight to raise awareness of climate change - but stops short of distancing himself from Credit Suisse.

A post shared by  Roger Federer (@rogerfederer) on Oct 7, 2019 at 7:50am PDT
""I take the impacts and threat of climate change very seriously, particularly as my family and I arrive in Australia amidst devastation from the bush fire,"" said Federer, who has arrived in Melbourne in advance of the Australian Open to play a fundraising exhibition tournament to help raise funds to combat the raging fires.
""As the father of four young children and a fervent supporter of universal education, I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the youth climate movement, and I am grateful to young climate activists for pushing us all to examine our behaviours and act on innovative solutions. 
""We owe it to them and ourselves to listen. I appreciate reminders of responsibility as a private individual, as an athlete and as an entrepreneur, and I’m committed to using this privileged position to dialogue on important issues with my sponsors.""

** After taking aim at Federer, who's next for Greta's climate shame ... **

* https://www.rt.com/sport/478253-greta-thunberg-roger-federer-climate-change-activists-who-next/ *

Swiss tennis icon Federer is used to defending on-court barrages but was forced to see off volleys of the verbal sort recently when he was criticized by hardcore environmentalists for his deal with sponsors Credit Suisse.
The climate change clan are unhappy with the 38-year-old’s association with the Swiss banking giant, which is a heavy investor in the fossil fuel industry.
'We owe it to them to listen': Roger Federer issues response after criticism from climate change activist Greta Thunberg
Those links came into the firing line again when a dozen activists appeared in court after refusing to pay a fine for playing tennis in braches of Credit Suisse back in 2018, in what was a swipe at Federer and his corporate sponsors.
The hashtag #RogerWakeUpNow trended on Twitter, gaining some serious traction when Swedish teenage climate change doyenne Greta Thunberg shared the message for the cause.
Since 2016 @CreditSuisse has provided $57 BILLION to companies looking for new fossil fuel deposits - something that is utterly incompatible with #ClimateAction@RogerFederer do you endorse this? #RogerWakeUpNowpic.twitter.com/ED1fIvb4Cr
As he so often does on the court, Federer (or at least his PR team) responded in slick, decisive fashion, issuing a statement saying that he “take[s] the impacts and threat of climate change very seriously.”
“As the father of four young children and a fervent supporter of universal education, I have a great deal of respect and admiration for the youth climate movement, and I am grateful to young climate activists for pushing us all to examine our behaviours and act on innovative solutions,"" the Swiss ace dutifully added.
“We owe it to them and ourselves to listen. I appreciate reminders of my responsibility as a private individual, as an athlete and as an entrepreneur, and I’m committed to using this privileged position to dialogue on important issues with my sponsors.” 
In other words, thanks for the heads up, but I’ve already netted the cash.
But if a sporting icon such as Federer – a legend with 20 Grand Slams to his name, and a man considered as pristine as his lily-white Wimbledon attire – is not safe from the climate change hecklers, then who else should be fearful?
Keeping just within the tennis tramlines, the shame-hungry activists could just as easily point the finger at women’s great Serena Williams.
After all, Williams also has sponsorship arrangements with a financial giant which invests in the fossil fuel industry: in her case JP Morgan Chase, which according to some estimates has lent almost $200 billion to gas and oil companies in recent years – dwarfing even the amount invested by Credit Suisse.
Download the song in my @Chase commercial for free for a ltd time & quantity: http://t.co/chbOfAZsVi#MasterTheOpenpic.twitter.com/Cph1Jp4GGm
Williams, 38, would seem to be a tougher target as a self-professed social justice crusader, a woke warrior, a mother no less – but would that spare her the ire of the environmental brigade?
The same could be said of countless other stars pocketing sponsorship deals across dozens of sports.
But if climate change activists are naming and shaming individual athletes, they could just as easily train their fire on whole events.
Taking just one example, the aforementioned JP Morgan Chase also happen to be official partners of the US Open. Does that make the hundreds of players who compete at the tournament guilty by association?
There are myriad other events that could feasibly face public shaming from the climate change crusaders, based on the sponsorship that actually helps make these events the popular spectacles they are.  
Cancel culture could metaphorically be applied to individuals, but literally as far as events go, should they be shamed into dropping sponsors. 
Moving up a level, whole sports will likely have the heat turned up on them from global warming protesters, no matter how much orgnizers make proclamations of moves toward reducing carbon emissions.   
Take motor racing and Formula 1, which would logically seem a sweet target. F1 chiefs have announced ambitions aims to somehow make the sport carbon neutral by 2030. 
As gas-guzzling drivers jet around the world, with armies of technical and support staff in tow, all in giant trucks and other assorted transport, they will at least have a clear conscience in the face of the slings and arrows from campaigners – that's assuming the sport hasn't been shamed out of existence by the end of the decade. 
The way we are headed, athletes, fans, and any and all events must be completely beyond reproach; if they don't fit the climate crew's exacting standards, they shouldn't be on the sporting calendar; if it's sponsored by anyone with a vaguely distasteful whiff to the virtue-signaling social media warriors, cancel it.   
No more athletes choosing their sponsors – the climate change clan will do that for them, handing them an ever-dwindling approved list. And while they're at it, they might just try to dictate which sports you watch, as well as when, where and how they happen. 
If all this seems far-fetched, then so did a spat between the world's most revered tennis player and a Swedish teen climate change activist, at least until a couple of days ago.

Published on Avaaz’s website, the left-leaning non-profit group released a report on January 16 that claims YouTube is profiting by broadcasting misinformation to millions of people by giving climate denial videos too much prominence. The report is an undisguised intimidation campaign, as not only does it list major advertizers who are running ads on videos that question the legitimacy of the threat climate change poses for humanity, but it explicitly calls for them to put pressure on the platform as a means of putting an end to the so-called disinformation.
Despite the findings being published just yesterday, many mainstream sites had lengthy articles posted not long after that, which featured quotes from those who worked on the report. Timings which suggest select websites were given early access, making it clear what agenda is being pushed, more so as they all tout the same talking points. Vice, Time, Gizmodo, The Verge, and countless other news entities want YouTube to punish creators who don’t toe the “correct” ideological line. The objective is to demonetize, and thus censor, such individuals as they’ll be less inclined to work on content that they won’t be able to profit from.
Nell Greenburg, a campaign director at Avaaz, claims the report isn’t about removing content, but that contradicts the report’s own messaging. There is a clear attempt to have content hidden as the report calls into question the promotion of such videos in the “up next” box on the site. It’s semantics at this point, but hiding videos would hurt creators and dissuade them from even trying to share their thoughts. It is an indirect way of removing ‘wrongthink.’
YouTube has already called into question the methodology of the report, but, given the media and powerful activist groups are targeting advertisers such as Nintendo, Red Bull, Uber, and Warner Bros, it’s a safe assumption the platform giant will give into their demands if their bottom line ever becomes affected. We are less than one year removed from Vox Media’s war on Google and its subsequent “adpocalypse,” after all.
Samsung has already contacted the company to “resolve the current issue and prevent future repetition,” so a second adpocalypse is probably likely. Though, this time, the scale could change as residing in the crosshairs isn’t just independent creators, but Fox News and other right-leaning media, given that they, too, have content on YouTube that questions the validity of a changing climate.
That the MSM agrees with this says a whole lot, since many websites are in no position to push a platform into limiting content they deem as false, especially when considering the one-sided nature of their many blunders. If 2019 was any indication, they’re not exactly on top of stuff. From the reaction to the Covington school kids, to the countless Trump and Russia stories that went nowhere and fizzled, the most blatant purveyors of literal fake news are the mainstream media.
As for George Soros’ connection with Avaaz, while it claims to be predominantly member-funded now, its seed money was reportedly allocated by the billionaire’s opaque network of groups, and various prominent figures from his Open Society Foundation, such as former Democratic congressman Tom Periello, have been among its leadership. Leaked documents from 2010 detail that promoting climate change campaigns was always designated as a primary function of Avaaz.
This situation ultimately raises questions into why anyone, or anything, should have the power to dictate what others can create. Regardless of one’s personal views on the matter, there’s no denying that bold claims have been made about the climate that later were disproven. Little is, as yet, set in stone, and content that lands on any one side of the debate should be free to exist. If a creator is making videos people are watching, their hard work shouldn’t be thrown in the bin simply because an activist group with ties to one of the world’s richest people and his proxies says so. It is not the role of billionaires and their pet projects to play babysitter.

Hollywood has an extended and rich history of depicting mankind in peril from various existential threats.
If you recall, it was Hollywood that showed us the nefarious nature of robots, like HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Skynet and their T-1000 killer robot minions (that speak with a strange Austrian accent for no apparent reason) in the Terminator franchise, and the dead-eyed evil of Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network.
Hollywood also raised the red flag concerning the threat from other worlds. Alien, Signs, War of the Worlds and Independence Day are among the many films that show what will happen when E.T. phones home and his dastardly reinforcements arrive to even the score.
Hollywood’s most accurate depiction of humanity’s inevitable destruction was shown to us in the various Planet of the Apes films. Watch the news long enough and you will surely stumble across some supposedly heart-warming story of an ape learning sign language – but don’t be fooled, therein lies a stepping-stone to mankind’s slavery under brutal ape overlords. I guarantee you that once enough of them learn to sign we will all end up wearing leashes and loin cloths and yelling at some descendant of Harambe to “take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!”
Which brings us to climate change, that scary storytelling device Hollywood adores. Movies like The Day After Tomorrow, Geostorm and Al Gore’s Oscar winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth have told the all too frighteningly real story of the climate crisis and how it will impact mankind.
Hollywood has taught us that climate change will inescapably lead to a post-apocalyptic, Mad Max type of world where we must wage endless resource wars that include some pretty spectacular car chases in order to survive.
Thankfully though, the Academy Awards showcase of Hollywood’s best and brightest has finally got this apocalyptic scenario covered, too – in real life.
What’s their plan? The noble geniuses at the Oscars have declared that instead of serving meat-based foods at their annual luncheon for nominees and in the theatre lobby on the night of the awards, they will instead serve only plant-based ones!
Take that climate change! Go straight to hell global warming! Way to kick ass Oscar and you are very welcome Mother Earth!
To be fair, the Oscars weren’t the first to come up with this ingenious plan, as it is the same one the Golden Globes put into effect at their most recent awards show early in January. After seeing the tremendous impact the Golden Globes magical vegetarian menu had on the earth over the last month, it is nice to see the Oscars deciding to double down on the effort.
The impact of the plant-based Oscar menu is impossible to overestimate. It seems extremely likely to me that by serving Tinseltown’s elite vegetables instead of chicken, not only will the Academy Awards halt global warming but also bring about world peace and maybe even end the scourge of physical ugliness so prevalent in non-famous regular people.
Just imagine how much better earth and all of its inhabitants will feel when self-satisfied movie stars fly to Los Angeles from across the globe in their private jets and then cruise in their first world limousines past the hordes of homeless that literally litter every nook and cranny of third world La La Land, and then go to an Oscars ceremony with its plant-based menu which these stars won’t eat anyway because they’re fasting so they look thin for photographs in their glamorous outfits. A complex problem like climate change doesn’t stand a chance in the face of that kind of total sacrifice and complete commitment.
I personally think serving a mostly vegan menu at an awards show is so much better for the environment than say, living a simple and sustainable life, or refusing to do any business with carbon based energy companies, or better yet, divesting from one of the worst degraders of the environment, the Pentagon, and deciding to stop being the propaganda wing for the American Empire.
How about this Hollywood… instead of self-congratulatory awards nonsense why don’t the Academy Awards have a full and healthy menu, but as an alternative to serving it to narcissistic actors, take it onto the streets of Los Angeles where 60,000 poor, tired and ill homeless people struggle to find access to clean water, food and sanitation as they scratch out an existence in tent cities beneath nearly every underpass and in every open space in the city. Maybe then the Oscars’ plant-based menu would make an actual difference in the real world instead of just in the delusional minds of self-centered eco-poseurs.
I’m just kidding. Let them eat cake! Just as long as it is an environmentally sustainable and 100% vegan cake.
And the Oscar for Best Faux Eco-Friendly Virtue Signaling goes to…

** Ignoring climate risks will result in global recession 'the likes of ... **

* https://www.rt.com/business/481023-extreme-weather-next-recession/ *

“If the market doesn’t do a better job of accounting for climate, we could have a recession, the likes of which we’ve never seen before,” said Paul Griffin, an accounting professor at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management, who authored “Energy Finance Must Account for Extreme Weather Risk.”
In a paper, published in the Nature Energy journal, he noted that the financial markets fail to link physical climate risk to company market valuations. One of the key messages of the report is that there is high “unpriced risk” in the energy market, which is exactly what caused 2008’s Great Recession.
“Right now, energy companies shoulder much of that risk. The market needs to better assess risk, and factor a risk of extreme weather into securities prices,” he explained.
Excessively-high temperatures seen in Europe and the US last summer, for example, are harmful not only for human health, but also “stunt economic growth” by causing problems such as fires which can severely affect supply chains, including energy and water delivery. Thus, natural disasters pose a threat to businesses and can eventually disrupt the entire economic system.
Another problem is that some key facilities, like oil refineries on the US Gulf Coast, could be exposed to storms or flooding, while energy companies located in arid areas could be hit by wildfires, the author of the study notes.
“While proprietary climate risk models may help some firms and organizations better understand future conditions attributable to climate change, extreme weather risk is still highly problematic from a risk estimation standpoint,” he writes.
Another study, released by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) earlier this month, warned that global economic growth will be affected by the loss of nature. The authors concluded that if the world carries on “business as usual,” reduced supply of several ecosystem services would lead to a drop of 0.67 percent in annual global GDP by 2050 and cost the world around $10 trillion. The US, which has repeatedly refused to address climate issues since Donald Trump took office, would suffer the largest losses of annual GDP in absolute terms, losing $83 billion each year by 2050, according to the WWF report.

Trump and First Lady Melania left India for the US on Tuesday, after a jam-packed itinerary of photo opportunities, meetings with government leaders and business titans, and of course, a thunderous campaign-style rally in front of more than 100,000 adoring spectators.
But with the lights turned off and the cleanup underway, Trump is now looking for India to do its bit to satiate the obsession he is known-for around the world – trade.
President George W Bush was fixated on winning the “war on terror,” Barack Obama on defeating “climate change,” but it’s trade that keeps Trump up at night. The president won’t, for example, be drawn into Hong Kong’s ‘pro-democracy’ protests as long as he can muscle out trade concessions from China. India shouldn’t expect anything different.
Trump didn’t make any definitive statements on trade during his visit, though. The state trip was all about spectacle, and a reception unlike “anyone had received anywhere in the world at any time of history,” as Trump mentioned more than once in his interaction with the press on Tuesday evening.
The press corps looked for that one quote which could cast Modi in a poor light. But it never came. Kashmir was an issue “which has been on for a long time,” according to Trump. India’s contentious new Citizenship Act, the reporters were informed, wasn’t even discussed between the two leaders who had met privately in the afternoon. Trump viewed the ongoing violence in New Delhi as a matter India could handle.  
Of course, religious reforms figured in the talk between them, but Trump was assured that Modi’s nationalistic government meant no harm to any religious group.  When a specific question on Muslim rights was raised, Trump mentioned Modi and his “powerful statement” that the Muslim population in India has grown from 140 million to 200mn in a very short period of time.
Trump stood by Modi as the press grilled him on these contentious issues. But for a president who often sees international relations as a transactional game of give and take, the time will surely come when Modi must repay the favor.
Trump left for India last week declaring that the country had treated the US “very unfairly” on matters of trade. Though he hinted that a deal might be signed during the visit, he left with no specific agreement, saying that his team was “in the early stages of discussion for an incredible trade agreement.”
The US president noted India had managed to bring down its trade surplus with the US from $23 billion to $14 billion in a short period of time, but he expects more. 
India’s trade advantage vis-a-vis US is miniscule, at least 20 times less than what China enjoys against the US at $345 billion.  Yet it’s an irritant in Trump’s eyes. In 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum. In April of last year, India lost its spot in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme of the United States. This affected India’s exports to the tune of $5.6 billion.
India responded with tariffs of its own on 28 imported items from the United States. Its high tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles and retaliatory moves on farm and dairy products also didn’t go down well with Trump. India also seeks to improve its bargaining position in the service industry, and to secure more employment visas for its young and talented. For sure, this is not an exhaustive list of contentious trade issues, just a sample.
While Trump and Modi celebrated their bonhomie during the president’s 36 hours in India, the real work still continues behind the scenes. Trump will likely expect nothing less than a complete removal of tariffs and a closing of the trade gap. He said as much during a press conference on Tuesday, declaring that Washington and New Delhi’s trade relationship “has to be reciprocal.”
“The money you’re talking about is major,” he added. “The United States has to be treated fairly, and India understands that.”
To be fair, Trump has been unambiguous about what he expects from the world on trade matters. His inaugural address as President in 2017 was littered with mentions of America’s “foolish” trade policies, which he said “ripped” wealth away from America’s middle class, to be “redistributed all across the world.”
After delivering Modi a publicity coup de grace, and standing by the Indian PM’s handling of controversial domestic issues, Trump now surely expects some of that wealth to be redistributed back to America. The next question is, how much is Modi willing to give Trump?

** Climate change in Russia: Moscow temperatures exceeded norms ... **

* https://www.rt.com/russia/479994-climate-change-russia-moscow-temperatures/ *

By Jonny Tickle
After a summer of wildfires, with reports of melting permafrost, plus an abnormally warm winter in western regions, this year has started with more norm-defying weather. On Monday, it was reported that over 70 Russian cities experienced their hottest January since records began.
Now, you can also throw out the stereotype of a snowy winter Moscow. According to Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia, the average January temperature in the capital broke the all-time record by an eye-opening 1.6 degrees. They also exceeded the norm by 9.2 degrees.
""It was the warmest January in the history of meteorological observations. It is obvious that the weather has cascaded to a different temperature level,"" Vilfand told news agency Interfax.
The expert explained that the previous record, set in 2007, was -1.6 degrees Celsius, and the 2020 average was precisely 0°C — the highest since records first began in 1880.According to the Hydrometeorological Center, only one day — January 23 — corresponded to the standard expectations of January weather, and three of the days broke all-time records for that date.
Forecasts suggest that February will be considerably colder than January, but still abnormally warm compared to previous patterns. Russia's Environment Ministry has warned of ""catastrophic consequences"" in Russia if climate change accelerates. Temperatures in the country are rising at a faster rate than is typical globally.

** Save the planet & die alone: Swedish prof says we should ditch pet ... **

* https://www.rt.com/op-ed/480531-climate-change-pets-loneliness-religion/ *

A Swedish agricultural studies professor has joined the growing chorus of environmentally-conscious academics scolding pet owners about their four-legged friends' carbon pawprints. Cats and dogs eat meat, which produces significant emissions, and therefore should be replaced with herbivorous pets when possible, Sigrid Agenäs recently told Swedish outlet Expressen. While Agenäs does not join her more militant colleagues in insisting cat and dog owners attempt to feed their pets a vegan diet – a death sentence for cats, and a risk to dogs' health for the uninitiated in canine nutrition – anyone who owns a carnivorous pet can testify that it is not as simple as trading in Fluffy for a goat or rabbit. They aren't called ""fur babies"" for nothing – cats and dogs are increasingly the only living things keeping humans company in ever-more-atomized industrial societies.
Why are the climate militia setting their sights on pets? Birth rates are plummeting in Europe and the US, where record low fertility has long since dipped past the rate needed for the population to replace itself. While this trend was underway long before the climate brigade came along demanding women put off childbearing to save the planet, enough celebrities have taken up that line of argument that they can claim it as a victory and move on to people's four-legged children.
But if pets are one of the last things standing between an increasingly large slice of humanity and utter alienation – and if, as medical experts are saying, loneliness is truly worse than obesity in predicting future health problems – those who would replace our cats with goats are asking us to make a very difficult choice.
As we get used to the lonely green future without our furry friends, we can take comfort in the fact that we've kept planet-wide warming to a manageable level, though, right? Not quite – the carbon footprint of the world's domesticated cats and dogs pales in comparison to that of the US military, for example, which produces more emissions than most countries. Why, with elephants like this in the room, is the environmental movement setting its sights on dogs and cats? Aren't we already lonely enough?
It's not an idle question when nearly four out of five members of Generation Z report that they are lonely, more even than their notoriously disaffected older siblings the millennials (""only"" seven in 10 of whom report feeling loneliness). More than any other issue, Generation Z is concerned with climate change, according to a December survey conducted across 22 countries in which 41 percent named the phenomenon as their chief concern; a further 36 percent named pollution. But while ""eco-anxiety"" likely contributes to the spike in depression and anxiety  witnessed in Generation Z, the future presented as climate-friendly living, with no children, no pets, and an ascetic lifestyle that frowns on any form of carbon-emitting leisure, is liable to overwhelm them with feelings of loneliness.
But the misery that accompanies climate-change doomsaying is probably part of the attraction for some. Extinction Rebellion rallies have all the trappings of religious revivals – some play host to actual religious rituals – and the climate-change-obsessed preaching their low-consumption lifestyles can be likened to medieval devotees wearing hair shirts and whipping themselves in the public square. Guilt-stricken children of privilege can rush to absolve themselves in the eyes of some hypothetical Gaia by eating bugs, gluing themselves to trains, and renouncing the creature comforts their peers take for granted.
And with no children, no pets, and – apparently – no real-life friends to distract today’s young adults from the all-consuming quest to save the planet, environmental groups have never had more fertile recruiting grounds. Political movements the world over have long known that alienation is a feature, not a bug, when it comes to filling their ranks with soon-to-be ideological zealots.
If ditching cats and dogs fails to save the planet, there's always a silver lining. Before our pets' carnivorous diets heat Earth beyond habitability, Big Business stands to make a killing in psychiatric medication. After all, loneliness kills – kills worse than smoking, if the experts are to be believed. Generation Z is going to need medical intervention on a grand scale when they come out the other side of this green ‘phase.’

Spreading exponentially throughout the world since originating in the Chinese province of Hubei before Christmas, the Covid-19 coronavirus has claimed more than 8,000 lives and infected more than 204,000 people globally. Governments struggling to contain the rampaging virus have closed their borders, restricted social gatherings, and shuttered non-essential stores and businesses, in an unprecedented crackdown that British researchers say may last up to 18 months. 
Remember Greta Thunberg? Before Covid-19 threatened to wipe us all out, climate change was the apocalyptic story of the last few years. Thunberg spent the guts of the last two years shouting at our leaders to avert the coming “mass extinction,” as her followers took to the streets to demand the state outlaw cars, meat, air travel and even our beloved pet cats and dogs. “Go vegan or die,” they said, warning us that we have but 12 years to change our ways or perish in the coming eco-holocaust.
That’s the line they pushed, and the mass media dutifully repeated it. But climate hysteria has been relegated to the back pages by coverage of Covid-19. Thunberg and her devotees can find some silver linings though: not only does she not have to return to school (nice timing, G), but the virus has helped Mother Earth recover in ways that screaming, crying, and gluing themselves to trains never could.
In Wuhan – the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic – the streets are deserted and industry has been shut down. The corresponding drop in air pollution has been dramatic. One Stanford University researcher calculated that the improved air quality may end up saving 20 times as many lives as were taken by the virus. Satellite photographs from NASA show just how pronounced the drop-off has been:
China as a whole has seen its carbon dioxide emissions drop by a quarter in February alone.
Worldwide, at least 24 airlines are suspending operations completely. In a snapshot taken by FlightRadar 24 on Monday, 500 fewer planes were in the sky over Europe than on the same day a year ago. Quarantine measures and closed borders mean the downward trend will continue, according to FR24. Commercial aviation accounts for two percent of all global carbon dioxide emissions, meaning that even a 50 percent drop in air traffic would be equivalent to the entire CO2 output of Mexico.

Demand for oil has fallen, and fewer automobiles clog the streets of even famously gridlocked American cities like Seattle and San Francisco. But perhaps the most noticeable change is visible in Venice, where harsh lockdown measures have kept the normal throngs of tourists away. The city’s once-murky canals are now clear, and Venetians have spotted fish swimming in the waterways.

All of this is exactly what Thunberg wanted, albeit under different circumstances. A world without car and air travel is implicitly proscribed by Thunberg, and explicitly written out in the ‘Green New Deal’ – an ambitious piece of climate legislation pushed by the youth-led Sunrise Movement in the US and sponsored by more than 100 members of Congress. The Green New Deal also calls for the dismantling of all polluting industry and commerce, and would grant the government power to decide what you eat, how you build your home and how you travel.
Few will quibble with travel restrictions during a pandemic, and people will accept some lifestyle changes. But would we accept a life of isolation and deprivation as the ‘new normal’, all in the name of saving the planet?
Like hell we would. Even with a modern-day plague at our doorsteps, governments around the world have had to physically force people to remain at home. Hazmat-suited guards kept Chinese citizens in their apartments during the peak of the crisis in Wuhan. Italy has taken to fining or jailing citizens who break their quarantine. Spain and France have also fined their citizenry for breaking isolation rules, and deployed police to herd tourists away from popular spots.
In Ireland, revellers threw common sense to the wind and danced Sunday night away in the only pub in Dublin opting not to voluntarily close. In France, looting and fighting has been reported. The point is that even with the lives of their families at stake, people will still attempt to defy the advice of their leaders.
And so it would go in the green utopia envisioned by Thunberg and friends. Even with the growth of “flight shaming,” people will still take to the skies, unless forced not to. People will drive until their cold, dead hands are pried from the steering wheel. Despite the best efforts of the liberal media to shame readers into literally confessing their “climate sins,” people will still choose to live a life of modern convenience over a life of self-imposed eco-asceticism.
When the coronavirus is eventually controlled, governments will hand out massive cash bailouts to get the world economy back on its feet. US President Donald Trump promised a trillion dollar stimulus package on Tuesday, including $50 billion to the airline industry.
But once things are back to normal, the environmental debate will likely start anew. This time, the Greta Thunbergs of the world can point to the current, virus-induced environmental uptick as proof that we can – when push comes to shove – give up our carbon addiction. However, remember that if your leaders are serious about meeting the climate goals they promise to, the lifestyle changes they ask of you will need to be enforced with the machinery of the state. 
In ‘Discipline and Punish’, postmodern theorist Michel Foucault noted that in the Middle Ages, the bubonic plague could only be controlled by “omnipresent and omniscient” surveillance, coupled with draconian punishment for those who violate the lockdown. Foucault called the plague a “political dream,” which gave the powerful justification to regulate the “smallest details of everyday life.”
State-enforced travel bans and mandatory isolation are extreme measures for a desperate time. Don’t let the environmental crusaders make them a blueprint for the future.
And while you’re at it, ask Greta whether the current drop in emissions has pushed back that ‘12 years to doom’ prediction we heard so much about.

** Amazon burning in 2019 was bad, but nowhere near as apocalyptic ... **

* https://www.rt.com/news/482523-amazon-burning-2019-average/ *

Far from the apocalyptic headlines depicted in the mainstream media frenzy, it appears that the Amazon may not be doomed just yet. While there was a small increase year-on-year between 2018 and 2019, the number of fires in relation to the national average over two decades was only slightly up. 
Changes in climate conditions, regulations as well pre-existing deforestation and degradation all play a role in how prolific the Amazonian fires will be in any given year. 
According to a recent paper published in the Remote Sensing journal, the Amazon saw some of the smallest increases in burned area compared with the yearly average.
The ESA's Fire Climate Change Initiative or CCI project analyzed burns across South America in both 2018 and 2019 and compared them to the yearly average data available from 2001 to 2018. The total area burned across South America was 70 percent higher in 2019 than the previous year, but only slightly above the average of the preceding 17 years. 
While obviously still cause for concern, Brazil’s total burn area in 2019 was only 1.7 percent higher than the long-term average, despite all of the breathless and apocalyptic headlines. 
Meanwhile Bolivia and Argentina saw increases of 51.4 percent and 49.4 percent respectively, compared to their yearly averages.
“Studies such as these are important to quantify and monitor fire activities in places such as the Amazon. However, they indicate the importance of long-term data series and studies using higher resolution sensors, such as the Copernicus Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument, to detect fires,” says Emilio Chuvieco, science leader of the Fire CCI project.
The ESA’s Fire CCI project takes a longer-term approach to issues like historical burning, fire management in general as well as to emissions analysis, to better establish and understand trends rather than focusing on localized, short-term events.

** Moscow's winter WARMEST in 140 years of records: Normally ... **

* https://www.rt.com/russia/482106-moscow-warmest-winter-record/ *

By Jonny Tickle
For the first time since records began, Moscow’s average winter temperature was above zero degrees. Meanwhile, the winter weather in the region surrounding the capital was similar to that of Berlin, Prague, Bratislava, Sofia and Vienna, and more characteristic for towns and cities in the south of the country, with averages an astonishing 7.7 degrees above normal.
Global warming took its toll on Russia across 2019. The summer months saw vast swathes of Siberia engulfed in wildfires and, in December 2019, President Vladimir Putin spoke of the risks of climate change for Russian cities within the Arctic Circle. Now the climate crisis has shown no signs of slowing down in 2020.
The winter of 2019-20 exceeded all records, beating the previous hottest period 59 years ago, according to a report by weather center Fobos.
“In the capital city, the average seasonal temperature exceeded the norm by 7.7 degrees. Moscow, which is [usually] the third coldest capital city in the world, had a positive average winter air temperature of +0.5 degrees,” Fobos wrote. It added that the warm winter will likely be followed by an even warmer March, and snow cover should “completely disappear” by March 5th.
Roman Vilfand, Scientific Director of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia, cited slightly different figures. He told the TASS News Agency that the average winter temperature in Moscow was 2.5 degrees warmer than the previous record of -2.8, set in winter 1960-61.
“I am sure that we are not going to see such a warm winter again for a long time,” he said.
He also suggested that the weather in the first week of March will be warm, estimating it to be between 6-9 degrees higher than normal.
It seems, however, that the abnormally warm winter will not turn into a scorching summer. An employee of the Main Geographic Observatory, Andrei Kiselev, said that the summer in the city will be moderate, citing historical data which shows that an unusually warm winter is typically followed by a moderately warm summer.
While the rise in temperatures around the world is having devastating effects on nature, there's a silver lining for some people. Due to the abnormally warm winter, the cost of heating will be revised, and many Russians will get some of their money back, according to the newspaper Izvestia. Residents of regions in which payments are charged evenly throughout the year, rather than measured by meters, will see an unexpected boost in their disposable income.
Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a national plan for adapting to climate change.

** MSNBC hates Bernie Sanders, Weinstein jailed, Malcom X ... **

* https://www.rt.com/shows/redacted-tonight-summary/481877-bernie-sanders-dnc-primary/ *

It seems like Bernie Sanders is running away with the DNC primary, and the corporate media are freaking out. It's really funny to behold and Lee is here to make fun of it with you. Both Chris Matthews and Chuck Todd have made Nazi allusions about the so-called ""Bernie Bros"" in the last few weeks, and that didn't stop the momentum of Bernie's anti-establishment campaign. Now the media have started to create a narrative that the Russians are supporting both Sanders and Trump. We'll see how it ends at the Democratic National Convention, where the DNC no doubt have more tricks up their sleeves. Also this week, Lee reports on Weinstein's conviction, Assange's extradition hearing and its similarities to a case where the US is refusing to extradite a CIA agent who ran over a British kid and escaped the country, and more on ""Taking The News From Behind.""
Naomi Karavani reports on how Attorney General William Barr is cracking down on cities that have said they won't help the Department of Immigration Control & Enforcement to deport immigrant residents within their communities. Communities that don't collaborate with ICE have taken the moniker ""Sanctuary Cities."" Finally, Natalie McGill looks into how climate change coverage from the US corporate media has been sparse. It doesn't reflect the extent of the climate crisis as explained by the scientific community.

** Protests, clashes & bare breasts: Rallies mark International Women's **

* https://www.rt.com/news/482625-womens-day-rallies-clashes/ *

Late on Sunday, activists took to the streets of Turkey’s largest city, condemning violence against women, only to be met with a violent police response.

Marches were held across Pakistan as well, with protesters calling for gender equality and an end to the practice of “honour killings” of women, still practiced in some areas by hardline Muslims. In Islamabad, participants of the Women's Day rally clashed with counter-protesters who advocated conservative values. 
In Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan a march opposing violence against women was targeted by a group of masked men, donning traditional Kyrgyz hats. The attackers snatched placards belonging to protesters and beat up some of them. Adding insult to injury, many protesters and attackers were detained by police in the aftermath of the scuffle.

A massive rally for gender equality was held in the Iraqi capital city, Baghdad, where participants spotted coronavirus protection measures.
But in Western countries protesters decided just going on to the streets was not good enough.

In Paris many protesters were seen dressed like WWII feminist icon, Rosie the Riveter, while others chose to wear next to nothing with placards reading ‘Stop the patriarchy pandemic!’
FEMEN’s performance on the Place de la Concorde combined feminist action with the coronavirus scare, as participants donned hazmat gear – on the lower parts of their bodies, at least – and ‘cleaned’ the streets of ‘patriarchal virus.’
Warning: Explicit Video
Another topless protest was held in London, this time combining climate change scare with feminism. The bare-breasted activists from the Extinction Rebellion group blocked Waterloo Bridge, while the inscriptions on their bodies read ‘Climate Murder’, ‘Climate Rape’, ‘Climate Abuse’ and so on.

Fonda, known for her opposition to the Vietnam War, was one of 17 climate protesters arrested Friday at the U.S. Capitol on charges of unlawful demonstration by what she called “extremely nice and professional” police. Fellow actor Sam Waterston was also in the group, which included many older demonstrators.  Now 81, Fonda said she plans to get arrested every Friday to advocate for urgent reduction in the use of fossil fuels. She hopes to encourage other older people to protest as well.  Getting arrested in 2019, poses some entirely new challenges, Fonda told The Associated Press in an interview.  These days, “they use white plastic things on your wrists instead of metal handcuffs, and that hurts more,” she said.  “The only problem for me is I’m old,” Fonda said. After her first arrest last week, she had trouble getting into the police vehicle because she was handcuffed behind her back and “had nothing to hang on to.”  On Friday, Fonda emerged from a cluster of officers and stepped smartly into the police wagon, her hands cuffed in front of her.  “Thanks, Jane!” some of the protesters called out.  “What would you tell President Trump?” someone in the crowd yelled to her earlier, as she and other protesters stood on their platform in front of the Capitol.  “I wouldn’t waste my breath,” she shouted back, drawing laughter.  Actor and activist Jane Fonda gives a thumbs up in handcuffs as she is detained for blocking the street in front of the Library of Congress during the “Fire Drill Fridays” protest in Washington, U.S., October 18, 2019. Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Reuters  The rally drew at least a couple of hundred people, young and old.  While Fonda has taken part in many climate demonstrations, she said Greta Thunberg’s mobilization of international student strikes and other activism, along with the climate writing of author Naomi Klein, prompted her to return to courting arrests for a cause.  Fonda cannot remember precisely which cause led to her last arrest in the 1970s.  She said her target audience now is people like her who try to cut their plastic use and drive fuel-efficient cars, for instance, but otherwise “don’t know what to do and they feel helpless,” she said. “We’re trying to encourage people to become more active, across the age spectrum.”  Actor Sam Waterston is handcuffed and detained by Capitol Police during the “Fire Drill Fridays” protest outside the Library of Congress in Washington, U.S., October 18, 2019. Waterson’s co-star in “Grace & Frankie”, Jane Fonda, lead the demonstration and was also detained. Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Reuters  Especially in the U.S., young people appear to be driving many of the protests and rallies demanding government action on climate change, University of Maryland sociologist Dana Fisher said.  Nearly half of the people who turned out for a September climate protest in Washington were college age or younger, and a quarter were 17 or younger, for instance, Fisher said. Most were female.  On the other hand, it was older, white females who turned out for earlier protests during the Trump administration, like the women’s marches, Fisher noted.  “There’s a whole group of very activated, middle-age white women. They woke up after the election, and they haven’t gone back to bed,” Fisher said.  So far, those people have not been involved in the youth climate movement. Fonda’s efforts could “get them out there,” Fisher said.  If her efforts misfire, Fisher added, the older people risk making the movement look uncool.  Asked how she would answer any young climate activist who complained of being co-opted, Fonda said, “I would hug them.”  And she did just that with some of the teenagers and other young activists she invited up to the stage to speak.  “It’s a good thing that Jane is doing, to try to shift the paradigm so it’s not just falling on young people” to rally the public on fossil fuel emissions, said Joe Markus, a 19-year-old Washington-area student attending Friday’s protest.  Leslie Wharton, 63, from Bethesda, Maryland, sat out the Vietnam War protests that drew out Fonda. She came out Friday as part of a group calling itself Elders Climate Action.  Lots of people of all ages are worried about climate change and want to do something, Wharton said, but “us elders are retired or part-time. We can take the time.”       Left: Actor and activist Jane Fonda blocks the street in front of the Library of Congress during the ""Fire Drill Fridays"" protest in Washington, U.S., October 18, 2019.

                                Oct 22, 2019 3:56 PM EDT     For decades, the conventional wisdom surrounding organic farming has been that it produces crops that are healthier and better for the environment as a whole.  In the U.S., where organic food sales totaled nearly $50 billion last year and made up 5.7 percent of total food sales, companies such as Annie’s and Organic Valley market their products as leaving a low carbon footprint. They remind consumers that their ingredients “matter…to the planet we all share,” or that their farming practices “remove excess carbon dioxide from the air.” The International Federation of Agriculture Movements promises in its literature that organic farming can “help reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the agricultural sector of the European Union and beyond.”  But a new study out this week challenges this narrative, predicting that a wholesale shift to organic farming could increase net greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 21 percent.  “We’re not saying that organic is wrong,” said Adrian Williams, an associate professor of environmental systems at Cranfield University in the U.K., but that consumers and environmental organizations would be wise to consider what these farming practices would look like on a much larger scale before making assumptions about the environmental impacts. Williams worked on the study published in Nature Communications on Tuesday .  While it’s unlikely that any country will pursue a complete, 100 percent transition to organic farming anytime soon, the study falls in line with others that raise questions about the degree to which these practices can mitigate the effects of climate change — and how market forces limit their ability to do so.  What would a shift to 100 percent organic look like?  Much research has been done about the link between organic farming and greenhouse gas emissions in smaller, niche settings, from grassland farms in Southern Germany to suckler-beef producers in Ireland. Results have been varied — while organic farming practices lowered greenhouse gases in some scenarios, in others, emissions grew or remained constant.  A team at Cranfield University sought to expand this scope of research by predicting how far the food supply would carry if England and Wales made a switch to 100 percent organic farming.  “The question was, how much could we produce using only organic methods?” Williams said.  A cock walks by cat at Siegfried Marth’s organical breeding farm in Hagensdorf, Austria, October 17, 2018. Photo by REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader  Forty percent less, it turns out. Organic farming typically produces lower crop yields due to factors such as the lower potency fertilizers used in the soil, which are limited to natural sources such as beans and other legumes. Williams’ model found that a 100 percent organic farming system in England and Wales would mean much smaller crop yields. For wheat and barley, for example, their production would be halved relative to conventional farming.  “Having established that there would be a shortfall in massive production, the gap would be filled by increased imports, ” Williams said.      If we try to have the same diet and convert to organic, we can’t really do it without expanding agricultural land demands.   This outcome could lead to a 21 percent rise in greenhouse gas emissions from England and Wales because those imports would likely be raised overseas through conventional agriculture. Such a transition would render moot the potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be achieved by the switch.  Even though the Cranfield study is hypothetical in nature, environmental sociologist Julius McGee said “it’s a useful tool to pick apart agriculture’s relationship to climate change.”  McGee took a similar approach back in 2015, when he authored a study that found the rise of certified organic production in the United States did not correlate with declines in greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and organizations should consider these driving market forces more carefully when touting the potential environmental benefits of organic farming, he said.  “The goal of agriculture is not to produce enough food to feed people, it’s to make the most money,” said McGee, who works at Portland State University and wasn’t involved in the Cranfield study. “I was trying to get people to look beyond the elements of consumer society. Organic is a niche market, and it’s able to make a certain amount of money based on people’s desire to consume organically produced goods.”  Will profits prevent an organic cleanup?  Some scientists posit that as long as agriculture remains focused primarily on profit, organic farming will only have a minimal impact on environmental protection and reducing climate change.  Michel Cavigelli, a soil scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, works with farmers in the mid-Atlantic who are seeking to convert to organic farming. He said while the farmers in this region express concerns about the environmental harms and impacts of the agrochemicals used in conventional farming, the reason they decide to switch to organic practices is often partly driven by economics. Market demand for organic products is expected to reach $70 billion by 2025, making these crops more profitable in the long run.  “In general, it’s accepted that you are going to have lower yields, but the price premium makes up for that on the economic side, from a farmer’s perspective,” said Cavigelli, who wasn’t involved in the Cranfield study. He added “they’ll live and die” by their bottom line, not their yields.   Cavigelli also noted that while the USDA has had standards for labeling organic products for more than 20 years and its creation was as much about market demand as anything.  “USDA doesn’t say that organic is better or worse,” Cavigelli said. “There’s a public demand for it, we need to meet that need. That’s kind of been USDA policy since 1997.”  Adrian Williams of Cranfield University said the U.K. could not sustain a switch to 100 percent organic with the national diet the way it currently is, but that might not be the case if market demand for certain foods changed.  “The real message is that if we try to have the same diet and convert to organic, we can’t really do it without expanding agricultural land demands, simply because it yields less than the current system,” Williams said, adding that testing a model where consumers sought out less red meat and more plant-based foods and fish could result in lower greenhouse gas emission yields from organic farming.  Organic farms and the regenerative movement face a long road to sustainability  Proponents of organic farming acknowledge the issue of low crop yields raised by the Cranfield Study, but maintain that farmers can still find ways to reduce their carbon footprint by focusing on “regenerative practices.”  Erin Callahan, director of the Climate Collaborative, based in Vermont — an organization that seeks to reverse the emissions pollution effects created by climate change in the natural food industry — recognizes that “the yield question is a big one” when it comes to mitigating the harmful environmental effects of agriculture, but warns against reducing the discussion to a matter of “organic versus conventional.”      Shifting all global cropland to a regenerative model could cut annual CO2 emissions by more than 100 percent.   “Making the food system more efficient, wasting less food, and trying to shrink the gap in yield…is the right method forward if we actually want to have agriculture be the solution for climate change,” Callahan said, who said that the current food system in the U.S. would have to change in order for organics to make a significant impact on reversing the effects of climate change.  Callahan’s organization advocates for companies like General Mills — which pledged in March to regenerate 1 million acres of farmland by 2030 — to find ways to capture more carbon in their soil, even if that doesn’t mean switching over entirely to organic practices. As part of their initiative, General Mills launched a regenerative agriculture scorecard for farmers to assess their soil . They also tested regenerative practices on one of their partner pastures that resulted in 68 percent less greenhouse gas emissions.  There is evidence that these practices do work to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions in certain controlled situations. A widely cited white paper by the Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania found that shifting all global cropland to a regenerative model could cut annual CO2 emissions by more than 100 percent. (Reminder: The planet will likely need to achieve a state of negative emissions to waylay climate change.)  “Organic is a really important piece of the puzzle when you’re looking at how to fix the food system,” Callahan said. “But until then, introducing regenerative practices of any kind to do that can help.”       Left: For decades, the conventional wisdom surrounding organic farming has been that it produces crops that are healthier and better for the environment as a whole. A new study out this week challenges this narrative.

These same rules apply to how we talk to children about the climate crisis. Young activists including 16-year-old Greta Thunberg of Sweden dominated news coverage during the U.N. summit and strikes across the world last week, but discussing global warming can be complicated because of the immediate and long-term anxieties surrounding the climate crisis. And kids can be affected even when they aren’t direct victims of a weather incident.  “I look at it through two lenses,” said pediatrician Samantha Ahdoot, a lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on Global Climate Change and Children’s Health. “Through the mental health consequences of extreme weather events, and through the effects of living in a world that is changing and the fear that it invokes in children.”  Thanks to decades of research , it is clear now that environmental disasters, like hurricanes and wildfires, contribute to mental health conditions among victims.  “Rates of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse things tend to increase after you’ve experienced an event like that,” said Susan Clayton, a conservation psychologist at The College of Wooster in Ohio, who co-authored a 2017 from the American Psychological Association and ecoAmerica 2017 entitled “ Mental Health and Our Changing Climate: Impacts, Implications, and Guidance .”  But mainstream media coverage can also mentally stress those who witness these tragedies from afar , in what’s known as vicarious psychological trauma.  Here are a few “what to do’s” for parents of climate crisis generations, according to a psychologist, a pediatrician and a school counselor, interviewed by the PBS NewsHour.

In the U.S. alone last year, two climate-fueled hurricanes ( Hurricane Michael , Hurricane Florence ) and two wildfires ( Woolsey and Camp fires in California ), created more than 1 million extreme weather migrants — those who had to move either temporarily or permanently after the disasters.  Ahdoot said she’s seen a number of children who were impacted by the recent hurricanes in Florida and Puerto Rico in her pediatric clinics in Alexandria, Virginia. They are struggling to verbalize the feelings associated with escaping the disasters, she said.  That’s likely because extreme weather events can devastate the social foundations of children’s mental health and well-being. Children lose family members, their homes or schools, or even access to resources like their doctors. Surviving the fallout of a weather disaster — such as living in a shelter or needing to relocate, even temporarily — can cause significant mental health consequences.  After their home in Paradise was destroyed by the Camp Fire, Landyn Butts, 3, and his family shop for new household items in Chico, California, on Nov. 18, 2018.

While it’s harder to trace, increases in heat have been tied to upticks in aggression and crime , increased suicide and more hospitalizations for mental, behavioral and cognitive disorders. In one study in Australia, researchers found drought — which can be more frequent and more extreme thanks to global warming — was associated with suicide rises among rural farmers .  Clayton and Ahdoot recommended that parents tailor their responses to these kinds of events to fit the age of the child. For infants, they recommend that parents try to save so-called comfort objects — any toy, blanket or other item to which a young child has a special attachment — if it can be done safely.  “If they lost that, maybe get a get them a substitute,” Clayton said, because doing so can reinforce social support. Reminding children of these support networks is one of the most crucial steps after a disaster, she added. “Whatever they can be provided with in terms of family or social support will help them.”  Climate change environmental teen activist Greta Thunberg takes part in a climate strike march in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on Sept. 27, 2019. Photo by REUTERS/Andrej Ivanov  The stakes are higher the younger a child is, because experiencing early trauma can permanently change the way a person responds to trauma later in life. Early exposure to trauma can make it more difficult to regulate emotional responses and increase a child’s chances of depression and PTSD .  If a toddler or elementary-age child asks about what is happening, Clayton recommended speaking frankly because even young children can demonstrate a profound amount of resilience. But don’t offer too much detail.  “I would not lie to them, of course, but emphasize that things are gonna be O.K.,” Clayton said. “Just say ‘Well, sometimes big storms happen and we thought we were ready, but this was worse than we thought. We’re going to make sure that we’re safe from weather in the future.”  Older children can handle a broader explanation of the disaster and its consequences because most are exposed to current events and have some awareness of the issues. Teenagers also do not respond well when adults are not transparent with them and they learn the facts on their own, Clayton said.  “Even teenagers need security so they don’t feel like things are completely out of their control,” Clayton said.      Photo by REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw   Why Greta resonates with kids   It’s been written that Greta Thunberg seems like a real-life Katniss Everdeen, the teenage protagonist from the “Hunger Games” books who battles against a dystopian, tyrannical government. The analogy isn’t far-fetched.  Conservation psychologist Susan Clayton said Greta Thunberg resonates among young people because her solo protests — which started in front of Swedish Parliament in August 2018 — grew so quickly. “The idea that one person could have that impact is inspiring to everybody, but especially to young people because she is a young person,” Clayton said.  Thunberg’s bluntness, which may be aided by her autism , contributes to this popularity, Clayton said, because it reinforces her dedication. People get the sense that she’s really saying exactly what she thinks and what she means. She’s not trying to be nice, Clayton said.  “It’s like what supporters will say about Donald Trump. He says what he thinks and they respect him,” Clayton said. “The same is true for her. She’s clearly saying what she thinks rather than what she thinks she should say. That’s very powerful.”     For a child worried about the Earth’s future  A growing number of Ahdoot’s pediatric patients are also expressing general unease over the Earth’s environmental trajectory. She recalled one teenager who visited her clinic last year after a trip to Germany to visit her mother’s family.  “The hotel didn’t have air conditioning so she said she spent most of the trip in the house taking baths because that was the only way that they could get cool,” Ahdoot said.  Another patient had a similar experience after visiting France this summer during record heat waves. In both cases, the children were exposed to the consequences of a warming world in a way they weren’t at home. Those kinds of episodes — especially when contrasted with the knowledge that their parents didn’t face the same kind of challenges growing up — can be frightening for kids, Ahdoot said.  Combine those omens with regular news coverage of the climate disasters, Clayton said, and it is easy to comprehend the views of young climate activists toward older generations.  In an effort to prove the severity of the climate crisis and its effect on her generation, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic to New York to speak during the United Nations General Assembly last week.  “This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean,” Thunberg said during her speech at the U.N. Climate Summit in New York City on Monday. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”  To help minors cope with what they’re seeing in popular media, parents and other adults should speak to them at a level that they can understand.  “A high school student in most cases is going to be able to handle more information,” said Eric Sparks, assistant director for the American School Counselor Association, whereas with younger students, what you say needs to be more general.

Photo by REUTERS/Andrej Ivanov  For example, if a young grade schooler exclaims something like, “The world is on fire, so what’s the point of doing anything anymore” — as my young nephew did two weekends ago — Clayton said one should correct them in terms they can understand.  “You could say that, ‘Our atmosphere is like a blanket and it keeps the Earth warm, which is a good thing. It’s just that the blanket is too thick now because of gases we put in the air,” Clayton said. “Give them some simple metaphor, so they have a better sense of what’s actually happening.”  For all age groups, Ahdoot, Clayton and Sparks said parents should avoid defeatism because the world isn’t doomed. They also said to emphasize that there is still time to waylay the worst outcomes through environmental actions. A young child, for instance, could be taught how to compost their scraps, the value of growing vegetables or the benefits of switching to reusable water bottles.  “An elementary school child can understand why it’s better to walk to their friend’s house instead of being driven, or why they can wear a sweater in the house instead of just cranking up the heat,” Ahdoot said. “Parents can convince their schools to bring clean energy to their energy supply. They can testify to the town or even to the United Nations.”      The second of season of HBO's Big Little Lies dives into climate change and child psychology. Photo by HBO   How to talk with your child about global warming, in 3 steps   In 2016, the Obama administration released a report predicting how climate change will affect humans, including an entire chapter on mental health and well-being. Much of the psychological burden of facing the global crisis will fall on today’s youth and the generations to come. A 2018 review paper found children already exhibit high rates of concern over climate change . Moreover, studies show that living through extreme weather events increase the childhood risk of mental health conditions like PTSD, depression, anxiety, phobias and panic, sleep disorders, attachment disorders, and substance abuse.  The PBS NewsHour asked Lise Van Susteren, a psychologist and climate advocate about the best ways to discuss global warming with children.  Step 1. Find out what the child has heard. Give a child the chance to unburden himself or herself emotionally. Give them plenty of room to do that. You need to know what it is that you’ll need to address.  Step 2. Be relatable and honest. You need to say, “Well, I’ve heard about those issues too, and I’ll be honest with you, there are a lot of people that are worried about this. You’re not the only one.” Stress that they’re not unusual or crazy or vulnerable for feeling the way they feel.  Step 3. Explain what they can do about it. Use examples they can understand — “Global warming is why we turn off the lights when we leave a room,” or “Climate change is why we bought a hybrid car.” It’s your opportunity to go through the list of things that you do personally as a family to reduce the likelihood of environmental harm to things your child might care about, like animals. If the child is older, tell them to engage in prosocial environmental activities like organizing a cleanup of a park .     What if you don’t want your child to be exposed to climate stories?  This week, conservative pundits responded to Thunberg’s speech at the U.N. Climate Summit with a range of criticism and attacks, including one said that the 16-year-old is instilling “fear in millions of kids around the world.”  Such assertions raise the question of whether parents should avoid talking about climate change with their children altogether.  Ahdoot, Clayton and Sparks said that trying to sidestep such discussions is a fruitless task because climate change is an empirical reality — backed by decades of study.  “We don’t need to hide reality from them,” Ahdoot said. But “we need to be cautious about how we presented it to them.”  Graphic media coverage of a disaster — like a mass shooting — can have deleterious mental effects. But trying to conceal the truth can also generate fear, harm a child’s ability to trust and skew their objectivity. Along those lines, Clayton and Ahdoot said it’s important to provide minors with reliable sources of climate information.  “Children get worried when they feel like something’s being kept from them because that means the problem is so bad that people aren’t talking about it,” Clayton said. “If you think one of your parents is sick and nobody’s telling you about it, then you really start to get scared.”  As they can with sexual education, parents can always opt out of pieces of climate curriculum. But there’s no real way to insulate students from the climate conversation.  “A school’s responsibility is to build a place where students can have and share differing viewpoints,” Sparks said. “It’s probably unrealistic to think that a student could be completely shielded from the climate issue.”       Left: A child holds placards during a protest march to call for action against climate change, in The Hague, Netherlands September 27, 2019.

In a report being released Monday, the Government Accountability Office called on Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler to state directly that dealing with the rising risks of seas, storms or wildfires breaching Superfund sites under climate change is part of the agency’s mission.  The findings in the report, obtained by The Associated Press, emphasize the challenges for government agencies under President Donald Trump, who frequently mocks scientists’ urgent warnings on global heating. Wheeler’s highest-profile public remarks on the matter came in a March CBS interview, when he called global heating “an important change” but not one of the agency’s most pressing problems.  “Most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out,” Wheeler said then, rejecting conclusions by scientists that damage to climate from fossil fuel emissions already is making natural disasters fiercer and more frequent.  Largely avoiding the words “climate change,” the agency in a formal response rejected the GAO finding that the agency was making a mistake by not spelling out that hardening Superfund sites against a worsening climate was part and parcel of the EPA’s mission.  The EPA believes “the Superfund program’s existing processes and resources adequately ensure that risks and any adverse effects of severe weather events, that may increase in intensity, duration, or frequency, are woven into risk assessments,” assistant EPA administrator Peter Wright wrote the GAO in response.      “By refusing to address the worsening impacts of climate change…this EPA is putting public health at risk.”   GAO investigators looked at 1,571 Superfund sites, contaminated locations that, according to the EPA website, exist nationally due to hazardous waste being dumped, left out in the open or otherwise improperly managed. That number does not include Superfund sites owned by the Defense Department and other federal agencies.  At least 945 of them are in areas that scientists have identified as at greater risk of floods, storm surge from major hurricanes, wildfires or sea-level rise of 3 feet (0.9 meters) or more, the GAO says.  Broken down, that includes 783 Superfund sites at greater risk of flooding under climate change, 234 Superfund sites at high or very high risk from wildfires and 187 sites vulnerable to storm surge from any Category 4 or 5 hurricane, the researchers said.  Senate Democrats asked for the review of how ready EPA’s Superfund program is for climate change.  Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee, urged the agency to follow the GAO’s recommendations.  “By refusing to address the worsening impacts of climate change – from flooding to wildfires to more frequent extreme weather events – at our nation’s Superfund sites, this EPA is putting public health at risk,” Carper said.  GAO investigators cited California’s 150-year-old Iron Mountain mine, where Superfund operators daily prevent tons of toxic sludge from pouring into the Sacramento River system, source of one-fifth of the state’s water.  READ MORE: This new ‘battery’ aims to spark a carbon capture revolution  Scientists say that the state’s increasing, and increasingly intense, wildfires are a sign of what the country will be seeing as the climate deteriorates. One major wildfire last year overran the Iron Mountain Superfund site, nearly destroying its water-treatment system and risking a massive, poisonous explosion if flames reached the heart of the mine, the GAO said. Firefighters used special gear to stop the flames. Operators of the Superfund site have since swapped out PCB pipes carrying away the toxic waste for flame-resistant steel ones.  And east of Houston along the San Jacinto River, record rains under Hurricane Harvey in 2017 again dissolved part of a temporary cap on a 40-acre (16-hectare) Superfund site, exposing contaminated material. EPA testing there afterward found dioxin at more than 2,000 times the maximum recommended level.  When it comes to climate change, Superfund sites in that coastal part of Texas “are incredibly vulnerable,” said Jackie Young, head of the Texas Health and Environment Alliance advocacy group. While the EPA has since directed that the toxic waste at the damaged site be moved to higher ground, other Superfund sites in the area are still at risk, Young said.  “It’s highly unacceptable that our communities and our first responders” in hurricanes and other disasters “may be exposed to contaminants someone left decades prior,” Young said Friday.  The EPA’s current five-year strategic plan does not include goals or strategies for handling growing risks under climate change, the GAO report said. The most recent previous five-year plan, under President Barack Obama’s administration, listed addressing climate change as one of four main strategic goals for the agency and specifically addressed climate change’s impact for Superfund sites, the investigators said.  A GAO review of climate-change-minded planning for keeping the arsenic, mercury, PCBs and other dangerous waste at Superfund sites away from the public and environment found big differences among the 10 EPA regions nationally.  WATCH: What U.S. withdrawal from Paris climate deal  Officials at four EPA regions were able point to changes they’d made at specific Superfund sites to try to adapt to climate change, the report said. At the country’s other EPA regions, however, EPA officials said they had not looked at climate-change projection for flooding or rainfall to gauge risks at Superfund sites, investigators said.  In the EPA region covering Texas and four other south-central states — a region that includes the Gulf of Mexico and Houston and other oil and petrochemical hubs frequently battered by hurricanes — officials “told us that they do not include potential impacts of climate change effects or changes in the frequency of natural disasters into their assessments,” the GAO investigators wrote.  In the Great Lakes states, meanwhile, regional EPA officials “told us that they do not have any formal direction on how to address risks from climate change and are waiting for EPA headquarters to provide information on how to do so,” the report said.

She has also drawn sustained attention for her enduring — and sometimes controversial — activism. Judy Woodruff sits down with Fonda to discuss her climate advocacy, what it's like to spend a night in a D.C. jail and how young activists like Greta Thunberg are shaping a new movement.   Read the Full Transcript     Judy Woodruff:  Finally tonight: Jane Fonda has been a household name for decades due to her prolific work on screen and stage, and to her enduring activism as well. Her cause now? Taking on climate change.      Jane Fonda:  You obviously know what this is like, but I have never felt it before.      Walter Matthau:  The winner is Jane Fonda. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)      Judy Woodruff:  Two Academy Awards, seven Golden Globes, a prime-time Emmy. The list goes on. From her start in 1960, on stage and then on screen, Jane Fonda quickly won recognition and stardom, movies from ""Barefoot in the Park"" and ""Barbarella"" ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"", ""Klute,"" and ""Coming Home."" She became a household name.      Jane Fonda:  I'm so happy.      Judy Woodruff:  Followed by ""The China Syndrome,"" ""On Golden Pond,"" and ""9 to 5."" After a break in the '90s, she relaunched her career in film, on stage and TV.      Lily Tomlin:  We made a hell of an accident, didn't we?      Jane Fonda:  We did.      Judy Woodruff:  As Grace Hanson in her current Netflix comedy series ""Grace and Frankie"" with Lily Tomlin. But all the while, activism has been threaded through Fonda's career, civil rights, women's rights, the Vietnam War. When she was photographed in Hanoi in 1972 sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, detractors called her Hanoi Jane and accused her of undermining U.S. troops. Years later, she apologized and went on to protest the Iraq War and other causes. Today the now 81-year-old actress is still at it. She moved to Washington to focus on civil disobedience around climate change, inspired by 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg.      Woman:  Love you, Jane.      Judy Woodruff:  Fonda has been arrested four times in the last four weeks in what's become known as Fire Drill Friday.      Jane Fonda:  What we have to do is unprecedented.      Judy Woodruff:  She's pushing for legislation advocated by Democratic Party progressives.      Jane Fonda:  The Green New Deal is going to do more than the New Deal did. It's going to bring everyone to a fair playing field. We're going to make it happen.      Judy Woodruff:  Jane Fonda, welcome to the ""NewsHour.""      Jane Fonda:  It's good to be with you, Judy. We have known each other a long time.      Judy Woodruff:  We have. We're so glad that you're here. So, arrested four times in the last month, spent a night in jail, but not your first time.      Jane Fonda:  No, I was arrested in Cleveland in 1970.      Judy Woodruff:  And this time in Washington, in a Washington, D.C. jail. What was it like?      Jane Fonda:  In Cleveland, all the people that were in jail were white, and they were all black here. And it was pretty clear that they were in there because of poverty and racism and what grows out of that, mental health issues. I was treated fine, you know? But it made me very sad.      Judy Woodruff:  What is driving you to do this? You speak about the climate crisis. What was it that sparked this?      Jane Fonda:  You know, I made all the personal lifestyle choices, drive electric car, eat less meat, eat less fish, get rid of single-use plastic, and all that. And that's good and it's important, but it's not enough. And I knew what I had to do. I had to get out of my comfort zone and put myself on the line, in coordination with the young student climate strikers, the Sunrise Movement and those kids.      Judy Woodruff:  What's different about these young activists and what they're saying?      Jane Fonda:  Well, their lives are on the line. I mean, they're — they recognize that older people, we're robbing them of a future that's livable, and we don't seem to be paying though attention. Kids have been out front of this movement for a long time, you know, the Standing Rock young people and so many of them. But there's something about Greta Thunberg. It's the fact that she's on the spectrum.      Judy Woodruff:  Right, autism spectrum.      Jane Fonda:  Yes, Asperger's, and that gives her a focus. She doesn't get distracted. And when I read what happened to her — she had been studying in climate. And when she read the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that said, we have very little time left, and this is what we had to do, and then she looked around, and nobody was behaving the way they should be behaving. I mean, she said, if this is happening, people wouldn't be talking about anything else. And she was traumatized and stopped eating and speaking. And that really got to me. I knew that what she had seen was the truth.      Judy Woodruff:  At the same time, what do you say to the skeptics, I mean, the people who are outright saying, this is hysteria, we can't move this far this fast, we need to be sensible about this, yes, climate is an issue, but…      Jane Fonda:  There's only one way to be sensible, and that is to read — is to study the science. The scientists know. And just the other day, 11,000 of them issued a warning, saying there is no question that the Earth and its population is facing a dire catastrophe.      Judy Woodruff:  Even with that, just this week, President Trump formally pulls out of the Paris climate…      Jane Fonda:  Well, I mean, he's the fossil fuel president. His Cabinet is a fossil fuel Cabinet. He's — they have been bought off by the fossil fuel industry, which tends to do that, and subverts our democracy in the process. But our goal here with our Fire Drill Fridays is not to try to convince those kind of people. We're trying to get people who are not used to going into the streets and engaging in civil disobedience and risking getting arrests.      Judy Woodruff:  Think back to Vietnam. How is this period of activism different from back then? What's changed?      Jane Fonda:  What's changed is that everyone, not just our soldiers who are in a country fighting the people in that country, but the entire world is being threatened. It's an existential umbrella hanging over everything. That's what's changed. This has never happened before in the history of civilization.      Judy Woodruff:  And that's what's driven Jane Fonda to move to Washington and do what… (CROSSTALK)      Jane Fonda:  I mean, if you're a celebrity, and you're almost 82 years old, and you have young grandchildren, I mean, I don't know. I don't know what would happen to me if I didn't do it. I — what would I think about myself?      Judy Woodruff:  We said it. You are an 81-year-old woman who still has a phenomenally successful career in entertainment and television. You're as active as anybody could be in the environmental movement. Is there a message for older women today?      Jane Fonda:  When you're older, what have you got to lose? You're not in the marketplace for some guy who's scared of a strong woman, so you can rise to yourself and become who you are meant to be, and you can be brave. I mean, there are older people with gray hair out there every Friday that get arrested with me that are just so great. And some of them are nuns, and some of them are rabbis, and some of them just people who have come from different parts of the United States. And they're old, and it's just beautiful.      Judy Woodruff:  And is there more — you think there's more acceptance of that today than there used to be?      Jane Fonda:  There's always been. Older people have always been — older women have always tended to be the bravest.      Judy Woodruff:  And so what's your message to other women who are out there wondering, should I step into this or that, that I have been afraid to get involved in?      Jane Fonda:  Well, one of my purposes with Fire Drill Friday is to show people the new normal. This is the kind of thing that has to become normal, given what is going to have to happen. No matter who we elect in November, no matter how progressive and brave they are, it won't work unless we are going to hold their feet to the fire. Back in the — during the New Deal, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he said to the people who were in the streets rioting and demanding that he help them rise out of despair, because they were starving and they were so poor, and he said: I agree with you. Now go out and make me do it. And whether it's Obama or Jerry Brown, so many progressive politicians say to people: Make me do it. Make me do it. So, that means they can throw up their hands and say: Look, it's not my fault. Look what the constituents are making me do. We have to be in the streets and shutting down governments, if necessary, not just at the federal level, but state governments, local governments, town councils. We have to be very brave. And, for 40 years, we have marched and rallied and written and spoken, and not enough has happened. So we have to up the ante a little bit and risk getting arrested through civil disobedience. But we have to not be afraid. And we have to see this as the way good citizens of the United States need to act. We need to be in the streets making our demands heard.      Judy Woodruff:  Jane Fonda in…      Jane Fonda:  Judy Woodruff. (LAUGHTER)      Judy Woodruff:  … in Washington, making the case to fight climate change. Jane Fonda, thank you very much.      Jane Fonda:  Thank you, Judy. It's good to see you. Thanks…      Judy Woodruff:  And you.      Jane Fonda:  … for having me.

While it’s still far from hitting the market widely, food producers big and small are starting to get on board. Megan Thompson reports as part of our ""Future of Food"" series, supported by the Pulitzer Center.   Read the Full Transcript     Mark Bittman:  Industrial agricultural practices are leading causes of water pollution and climate change.  But it turns out, farming could also be part of the solution. Scientists are developing a new type of grain they say has a host of environmental benefits – and is pretty tasty, too. NewsHour Weekend's Megan Thompson has more. This report is supported in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.      Megan Thompson:  Carmen Fernholz has farmed corn, soy and small grains in western Minnesota his whole life. He was an early adopter of organic methods in the '70s. So he wasn't surprised when a researcher from the University of Minnesota approached him eight years ago, asking if he'd be willing to plant an experimental grain.      Carmen Fernholz:  And I says, ""you know me, I like to try anything once."" And so he got me enough seed to plant about two acres. From then on it was just a matter of experimenting.      Megan Thompson:  Fernholz was one of the first farmers to plant Kernza – a type of wheatgrass genetically similar to the wheat most of us currently eat.  It's the first grain cultivated for human consumption that's a perennial plant rather than an annual.      Lee DeHaan:  So, an annual plant is a plant that lives for one year and then dies.      Megan Thompson:  Agronomist Lee Dehaan has pioneered the development of Kernza at The Land Institute, a research non-profit in Kansas.  He explains that some of the fruits and vegetables we eat are perennials – plants that come back year after year without replanting.  But the grains we eat, which cover the majority of our farmland, those are pretty much all annuals.      Lee Dehaan:  … wheat, corn, soybeans, rice – all these plants live for a fairly short period of time and then die when we harvest them.      Megan Thompson:  Annual grains only have one year to reproduce before they die. So they grow quickly and produce a lot of big seeds.  And that's probably why our ancestors started cultivating and eating them. But planting new seeds every spring is costly and time-consuming for farmers.      Lee DeHaan:  We have to do this process of clearing the ground and wiping out everything to allow these annual crops to get started.      Megan Thompson:  It often involves tilling the land: turning it over to plant new seeds.  That can damage it, and release carbon stored in the soil into the atmosphere… contributing to climate change.  And because the plants die in the fall, the land often has nothing growing on it for several months a year.      Lee DeHaan:  When that happens, you have bare soil, you're going to have the opportunity for erosion so rain falling on the landscape washes soil away.      Megan Thompson:  Nutrients in the soil wash away, too, which can cause groundwater contamination. On the other hand, perennial plants stay in the ground for years. They have deep roots that protect the soil and hold nutrients in place. And those roots help trap carbon.      Lee DeHaan:  As we want to take carbon out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change, as we want to restore soil health and soil quality, we find that really essential piece of that is a really deep extensive root system and that really comes with the perennial plant that's going to live in that ground for many years.      Megan Thompson:  So, back in the 1980's, scientists decided to try to create a perennial grain with all those environmental benefits that could also produce lots of seeds to feed humans, like an annual. They started with a plant called ""intermediate wheatgrass"" used mostly to feed cattle, and spent the next three decades selectively breeding it for the most desirable traits, like high yields and big seeds. Today the new strains are trademarked Kernza.      Megan Thompson:  There are dozens of researchers working on Kernza around the world.  But the largest research program is located here, at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. Agronomist jake jungers helps lead the work here, in coordination with the land institute. He showed us a poster demonstrating how kernza has a vast root system compared with an annual wheat plant.      Megan Thompson:  How many feet long is this approximately in this image?      Jake Jungers:  In this image, the root system is about nine feet.      Megan Thompson:  Jungers is conducting experiments in 25 fields around Minnesota, and working with farmers, like Carmen Fernholz, to figure out how to make Kernza a commercially viable crop. But there are a lot of challenges. First, an acre of Kernza only yields about 25% of what an acre of regular wheat does. And those yields drop off dramatically after 2-3 years.  Another issue: The top of the plant that contains the seeds is so long, the seeds ripen at different times.      Carmen Fernholz:  And what happens is as the bottom kernels are finally getting ripe, the top kernels are starting to fall off and shatter. And so how do you make a good judgment on the most opportune time to harvest?      Megan Thompson:  Another problem: the size of the seeds.      Carmen Fernholz:  The kernel itself is a miniature wheat. And when I say miniature, it is miniature.      Megan Thompson:  So Fernholz must carefully adjust his combine in order to harvest it.  Through selective breeding, agronomists have approximately doubled the seed size.  But that's created another problem.      Jake Jungers:  We've increased seed size so much that the plant has a hard time holding up those larger seed heads and larger seeds. So it falls over.      Megan Thompson:  And that interrupts pollination and makes it hard to harvest. Jungers says it will take a lot more work to address all these issues.      Jake Jungers:  We're not sure how far away we are. It could be 15 years. It could be 30 years. Right now progress is really rapid.      Megan Thompson:  While agronomists work on those problems, University of Minnesota food scientists like Misen Luu are studying how Kernza cooks up in the kitchen, and analyzing its nutritional value.      Misen Luu:  It has superior in fiber content. It has higher protein, which is very much desirable in consumers today.      Megan Thompson:  Luu says compared with traditional wheat, Kernza can also have ten times the amount of antioxidants, which can prevent cell damage in humans. All this information will be valuable for food companies and consumers when – or if – Kernza ever hits the market widely.  But before that can happen, there are more questions.      Megan Thompson:  How are you gonna convince farmers to plant this?      Jake Jungers:  Well, one of the benefits of a perennial crop is that it requires fewer inputs, which means fewer economic investments. So you plant the seed once. And you could potentially get a crop for three, four, five years. Kernza also requires fewer herbicides, less nitrogen fertilizer.      Megan Thompson:  Doesn't there also have to be a market for the farmer to sell to?      Jake Jungers:  Yes, definitely. We can't just push a new crop on the landscape without a market. And as we develop the new crops, we're also developing the market and the supply chain.      Megan Thompson:  One way Jungers's doing that is working with small purveyors in the minneapolis-st. Paul area. One of the first restaurants to cook with Kernza was the Birchwood Cafe in Minneapolis. It's known for using local, sustainable and organic ingredients.      Tracy Singleton:  The first thing we did with it was to put it in pancakes.      Megan Thompson:  Tracy Singleton is Birchwood's founder.      Tracy Singleton:  There was no– no recipes for how to work with Kernza, like what ratio to use– what's the gluten content, any of that stuff. So, it was really– it was a lot of experimenting– by our bakers and our chefs back in the kitchen.      Megan Thompson:  Today Singleton's bakers and chefs put Kernza in everything from crackers to desserts to grain salads.      Megan Thompson:  The grain is nice and crunchy, it's got a nice chew to it.      Megan Thompson:  And, it turns out, Kernza's great for brewing.  Another local pioneer is Sandy Boss Febbo of the bang brewing company in st. Paul. She's put four Kernza beers on tap.      Sandy Boss Febbo:  Kernza has a bit of an earthy characteristic. It's a beautiful grain.      Megan Thompson:  Promoters say Kernza beer helped change the game in 2016 when outdoor gear giant Patagonia started selling it in stores like whole foods – bringing the grain to the mainstream market. And last spring, General Mills – one of the biggest food corporations in the world – produced a Kernza cereal. Carla Vernón is president of the company's natural and organic unit.      Carla Vernón:  We want to be an inspiration to other big players. We want to be a support network for farmers.      Megan Thompson:  Really crunchy, a little bit sweet. That's really good.      Megan Thompson:  But there are hurdles, like a very limited supply. Only about 100 farmers are growing Kernza in the whole country.  Vernón planned to sell ""honey toasted kernza"" in a handful of small grocery stores …      Carla Vernón:  But that first crop of Kernza that we were excited when we were harvesting it, we were ready to turn it into cereal, about 95% of that crop failed. And I'm gonna tell you the truth. There were some tears in our offices here.      Megan Thompson:  So General Mills introduced a ""limited edition"" version online, with the profits going to kernza research.  Despite the setback, Vernon says the company plans to introduce more Kernza products, with the goal of making them widely available by 2040. In the meantime, Kernza researchers are plowing ahead,  and farmers like Carmen Fernholz remain committed, too. In August, he harvested about 12,000 pounds of organic Kernza, which he sold to a specialty food processing company. But Fernholz says for him, it's about much more than making a profit.      Carmen Fernholz:  So if I can develop a crop that really cuts back on the soil disturbance, and yet is a great– revenue producing crop, and a food crop besides– to me it– it becomes a win-win-win for everybody.

The wires snap in blizzards and hurricanes, causing dayslong outages. Everywhere, power poles topple in all kinds of disasters, blocking escape routes.  Around the U.S., dealing with the vulnerability of overhead power lines — one of many problems that experts say will only get worse as the climate deteriorates — by burying them or strengthening them is spotty and disorganized on a national level, and painfully slow, at best.  Utilities say there’s no one best way to safeguard the millions of miles of U.S. power lines and that doing so would cost many billions of dollars — $3 million for a single mile of power lines by some estimates. Critics counter by pointing to the at least equally great economic costs of outages and utility-sparked wildfires. Estimated property losses for a single such wildfire, a California blaze that killed 85 last year, reached $16.5 billion.  Overall, electrical outages caused by bad weather cost the U.S. economy up to $33 billion in an average year — and more, in an especially bad weather year, the Energy Department estimated in 2013. The researchers estimated there were 679 widespread outages from harsh weather between 2003 and 2012.  After electrical wires sparked many of California’s major wildfires in 2017 and 2018, and threatened more this autumn, many there turned their fear and anger on PG&E, the state’s largest investor-owned utility.  Vicki McCaslin, a 60-year-old repeat evacuee in the San Francisco Bay area, described spotting a PG&E worker in her neighborhood during a lull in last month’s wind and fires.  McCaslin burst into tears as she begged the utility worker to cut off power to her area before the winds and wildfires resumed, she recounted. “It scares me to death to think of those kinds of winds with our power on.”  MORE: Could selling PG&E to its customers help solve California’s power problems?  Nationally, experts say, problems with 19th century-style set-ups of wires dangling from wooden poles will only grow as climate change increases the severity and frequency of hurricanes, wildfires, big snowstorms and other disasters like tornados.  It’s a problem nationwide, not just in California. In coastal states such as Florida, hurricanes topple poles and knock out power for days. And in heartland states like Minnesota, it’s wintry ice storms and high winds that bring the electrical wires crashing down.  Crucially, though, it’s not a nationally regulated problem. That means that across the country, involvement and funding from the federal government on burying and otherwise strengthening community electrical grids have been scattered and small-scale.  That’s because it’s state and local officials, not federal ones, who hold most of the direct regulatory authority over local electrical infrastructure and local utility rates, said Ted Kury, director of energy studies for the University of Florida’s Public Utility Research Center.  Federal regulators’ role is largely limited to overseeing high-voltage transmission lines that cross state borders.  Nationally, a 2012 study estimated one-fourth of new power lines are buried.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s hazard-mitigation program has handed out $176 million for 156 projects to bury power lines, in 16 states and four U.S. territories, FEMA says. Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation this year to encourage moving power lines underground, has been one of the top recipients, along with Minnesota.  But the FEMA hazard-mitigation grants for the work so far break down to a little more than $1 million per project. In California, where PG&E oversees 100,000 miles of overhead electrical lines, that average size of grant doesn’t cover the price tag PG&E puts on burying a single mile of line.  That mostly leaves households with the bill for doing any burying of power lines, mostly through increased electrical rates.  In practice, that means more affluent communities with the means to pay higher rates are sometimes the ones getting their lines buried, in decisions driven as much by looks as by safety and convenience.  In Palm Beach, Florida, a resort community of first, second and third homes, property owners paid attention when a utility begin to erect unlovely concrete power poles as part of an effort to harden the state’s electrical grid against hurricanes.  Instead of accepting the concrete poles, Palm Beach’s residents narrowly voted in 2017 to pay for a $90 million bond issue, paid for by property owners, to bury the overhead lines.  READ MORE: Millions are out of power in California, but were the PG&E shutoffs necessary?  “There’s big benefits,” said Steven Stern, manager of Palm Beach’s undergrounding utilities program, who noted hurricanes sometimes knocked out power for days. And “the look is fantastic.”  In some places, burying the electrical lines is all but physically impossible, utilities and others argue.  In parts of California’s Sierra Nevada and other ranges, for instance, that would entail excavating into granite.  In Florida, Mike Hyland, senior vice president of the American Public Power Association for community-owned utilities, has seen utilities try and fail to bury cable in the unstable sand.  Utility companies argue that in some parts of the country, burying power lines would make problems worse, especially as storms and sea rise worsen with climate change. Hyland points to Superstorm Sandy in 2012, when a nearly 14-foot tidal surge flooded underground electrical networks even as the storm toppled above-ground lines, depriving more than 8 million people of power.  For electric utilities looking at how to harden their networks against the varied climate change potpourri of sea rise, heavy rains, wind, drought and wildfires, “it’s all these scenarios coming at you,” Hyland said. “Plus at the end of the day you’ve got a squirrel jumping on your lines.”  In California, state leaders and ordinary people increasingly accuse PG&E of negligence for not moving faster to safeguard power lines serving more than 5 million homes and businesses.  California’s worst wildfire seasons on record, in terms of property damage and deaths, were in 2017 and 2018. State fire investigators found sparks from PG&E electrical equipment responsible for many of the fires. That includes the state’s deadliest fire ever, a wildfire — started by PG&E power lines — that killed 85 people and all but wiped out the northern California town of Paradise.  State investigations in recent years concluded the utility put a priority on financial performance, including diverting millions of dollars intended for safety upgrades to shareholders and to bonuses for company executives.  The state is requiring PG&E to make $5 billion in safety improvements, said Ann Patterson, one of the members of a team appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to safeguard residents from the electrical network. Burying power lines is “one tool in the toolbox” to that end, Patterson said.  PG&E spokeswoman Jennifer Robison says the utility has spent $15 billion on its electrical network over the last five years and will have buried or otherwise hardened 150 miles of power lines in 2019 by the end of the year.  PG&E proposes to cover, strengthen or bury 7,100 miles of overhead lines in the next decade, Robison said.  That’s less than one-10th of the utility’s existing overhead lines, however.  In the meantime, PG&E this year stepped up a controversial program of intentional cut-offs during times of high winds. Two months of widespread, repeat outages — one of which affected 2.5 million people — plunged countless into darkness and ignited criticism from lawmakers.

** When Selling Your Home, It Pays to Be a Climate Change Denier **

* https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2019/11/real-estate-climate-change-denier/ *

       About  Series  News     A Public Media Initiative from WNET About  Series  News          Original Feature  When Selling Your Home, It Pays to Be a Climate Change Denier  November 27, 2019         By Marlene Cimons  David Fisher worries about what could happen to his home on Fire Island in an era of rising seas. The two-story wood-and-glass house is only 75 feet from Great South Bay and sits less than four feet above the water level. Since watching water seep into his house during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, he has struggled over whether to sell the property now, while he still can, or to enjoy a few more years in the home where he and his wife spend much of their summers.  “I think about reality, and I realize that holding onto it is a gamble, and eventually it’s not going to be there,” said Fisher, 73, a book author whose primary home is Manhattan. “In fact, I think eventually Fire Island is going to disappear.”  His friend Herb Cohn, 77, has no such fears. Two years ago he sold his house, located a few blocks from Fisher’s, but anxiety over climate change had nothing to do with it. The sale was part of his divorce, and he would buy there again in a heartbeat if he could. He scoffs at the decades of research showing humans are heating the planet.  The friends’ disparate views about climate change aren’t just fodder for Facebook debates. Their beliefs may actually exert a measurable influence on real estate values, according to a new study . Researchers found that climate deniers, like Cohn, stand a better chance at getting more money for their homes, when compared to those who accept climate science, like Fisher.  “Climate change never factors into my decisions to buy or sell,” said Cohn, who traded his home for double what he paid for it 30 years ago. His optimism about the future may have paid off, researchers say.  A segment of Fire Island with six feet of sea level rise.

But the UBC research takes a novel approach, looking instead at how price trends fluctuate based on the attitude that sellers have toward climate change.  The scientists evaluated public opinion data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication , data on home sales from Zillow , and predictions of sea level rise from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They controlled for a range of factors, including the characteristics of different houses and the political preferences of residents.  “We then compute the price difference between a property that is projected to be flooded compared to one that is not,” Baldauf said. “We do this separately for ‘believer’ and ‘denier’ areas. And we find that the discount for properties likely to be flooded is greater in ‘believer’ than ‘denier’ areas.”    The proportion of adults who understand that humans are changing the climate in every county in Florida. | Source: Yale Program on Climate Change Communication   The price difference amounted to about 7 percent, according to the study. Notably, Baldauf said it was impossible to predict who had correctly valued coastal property, the global warming deniers or their climate-conscious counterparts.  “It could be that they are both wrong,” he said. “All our study says is that they can’t all be right.”  The researchers, who also included UBC Sauder professor Lorenzo Garlappi and University of Chicago assistant professor Constantine Yannelis, published their findings in the journal The  Review of Financial Studies.  Flooding is already hurting property values. Between 2005 and 2017, flooding led to a net loss of $16 billion in real estate value in coastal communities from Texas to Maine, according to research from First Street Foundation .  If humans fail to curb carbon pollution, sea levels could rise by as much as six feet by the end of this century, submerging an estimated 2 percent of American homes worth roughly $882 billion, according to a 2017 Zillow report . Authors found that more than one in eight Florida homes could be under water, while nearly one in 10 properties in Hawaii face similar danger.  Investors have always weighed the risk of natural disasters when looking at real estate. However, while they previously looked to past weather events to determine prices, in recent years, they have begun to consider future climate-related mayhem in making decisions.  Congresswoman Donna Shalala, Democrat of Florida, whose district includes Miami Beach, acknowledged the findings of a 2018 study that suggested rising seas have already suppressed coastal property values in the Miami area. However, she said that, in her district, she doesn’t see the polarization that Baldauf describes, as people in South Florida overwhelmingly accept the fact of climate change.  Properties along Miami Beach are threatened by rising seas. | Source: Pixabay  “There aren’t many climate deniers in South Florida,” she said. “We realize that, for us, it’s life or death.”  Shalala emphasized that local governments can take steps to protect coastal properties, which could help keep to home values aloft. She said that measures taken by her city have made residents feel more secure about their properties. As a result of those measures, Miami’s municipal bond ratings have improved, she said.  “Miami Beach has raised sea walls and streets, installed pumps and approved stronger building codes, including for hurricane-proof windows,” she said. “When people think it’s the end of Miami, they need to come down and see what Miami Beach has done. It has done a lot of things that residents feel have made a difference.”  Fisher, for one, is counting on his Long Island town’s beach restoration program — which replaces disappearing sand with new sand — to protect his house in the coming years.  “Our beach is in excellent shape right now,” he said. “Still, there’s no question there’s going to be more water, and the water’s going to be higher. I don’t deny it, and I do worry about it. But I remain hopeful that whatever’s going to happen doesn’t happen in my lifetime.”  Fisher doesn’t want to have to give up his summer home, saying that he has loved Fire Island since the moment he first set foot on it in 1973.  “There hasn’t been a day since that I haven’t been in love with it,” he said. “It’s my peaceful place. Everything is better when I am there.”   Marlene Cimons writes for Nexus Media , a syndicated newswire covering climate, energy, policy, art and culture.   miami real estate  new york real estate  sea level rise  Sea Level Rise  sea level rise miami     Previous Post  Op-Ed: The Amazon, climate change, and the art of filmmaking Next Post  Why Rising Temperatures Could Make Life Harder for Lupus Patients         Providing Support for PBS.org Learn More   Previous Posts  Climate change pushes Florida’s mangroves north This wind turbine technician wants you to work in wind energy — even if you don’t believe in climate change Want to stop climate change?

His community herds about 8,000 reindeer year-round, moving them between traditional grazing grounds in the high mountains bordering Norway in the summer and the forests farther east in the winter, just as his forebears in the Sami indigenous community have for generations.  But Inga is troubled: His reindeer are hungry, and he can do little about it. Climate change is altering weather patterns here and affecting the herd’s food supply.  “If we don’t find better areas for them where they can graze and find food, then the reindeers will starve to death,” he said.  Already pressured by the mining and forestry industry, and other development that encroach on grazing land, Sami herding communities fear climate change could mean the end of their traditional lifestyle.      Sami herding communities fear climate change could mean the end of their traditional lifestyle.   Slipping his hand from a massive reindeer skin mitten, Inga illustrated the problem, plunging his hand into the crusted snow and pulling out a hard piece of ice close to the soil.  Unusually early snowfall in autumn was followed by rain that froze, trapping food under a thick layer of ice. Unable to eat, the hungry animals have scattered from their traditional migration routes in search of new grazing grounds.  Half the herd carried on east as planned, while the rest retreated to the mountains where predators abound, and the risk of avalanches is great.  Elder Sami herders recall that they once had bad winters every decade or so, but Inga said that “extreme and strange weather are getting more and more normal, it happens several times a year.”  The arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. Measurements by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute show the country has warmed 1.64 degrees Celsius (2.95-degree Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times. In Sweden’s alpine region, this increase is even greater, with average winter temperatures between 1991 and 2017 up more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4-degree Fahrenheit) compared with the 1961-1990 average.  Snowfall is common in these areas, but as temperatures increase, occasional rainfall occurs — and ‘rain-on-snow’ events are having devastating effects. The food is still there, but the reindeer can’t reach it. The animals grow weaker and females sometimes abort their calves while the survivors struggle to make it through the winter.  “We have winter here for eight months a year and when it starts in October with bad grazing conditions it won’t get any better,” Inga said.  That is devastating to Sami herders, a once-nomadic people scattered across a region that spans the far north of Sweden, Norway, Finland and the northwestern corner of Russia. Until the 1960s, this indigenous minority were discouraged from reindeer herding and their language and culture were suppressed. Today, of the 70,000 Sami, only about 10% herd reindeer, making a limited income from meat, hides and antlers crafted into knife handles.  “Everyone wants to take the reindeers’ area where they find food. But with climate change, we need more flexibility to move around,” said Sanna Vannar, a young herder from a community living in the mountains surrounding Jokkmokk, an important Sami town just north of the Arctic Circle. “Here you can’t find food, but maybe you can find food there, but there they want to clear-cut the forest and that’s the problem.”  The 24-year-old is the president of the Swedish Sami Youth organization and, together with eight other families elsewhere in the world, they launched a legal action in 2018 to force the European Union to set more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Earlier this year, the European General Court rejected their case on procedural grounds, but the plaintiffs have appealed.  “We’ve said we don’t want money because we can’t buy better weather with money,” Vannar said. “We’ve said we need that the EU take action and they need to do it now.”  The EU’s new executive Commission is expected to present a ‘European Green Deal’ on Wednesday, to coincide with a U.N. climate conference in Madrid.  Herders have also started working with Stockholm University, hoping to advance research that will broaden understanding about changing weather patterns.  As part of this rare collaboration between Sami and science, weather stations deep in the forests of the Laevas community are recording air and ground temperature, rainfall, wind speed and snowfall density. Sami ancestral knowledge of the land and the climate complements analysis of data gathered, offering a more detailed understanding of weather events.  “With this data we can connect my traditional knowledge and I see what the effects of it are,” says Inga who has been working on the project since 2013 and has co-authored published scientific papers with Ninis Rosqvist, a professor of Natural Geography at Stockholm University.  Rosqvist directs a field station operating since the 1940s in the Swedish alpine region measuring glaciers and changes in snow and ice. But through the collaboration with Inga, she realized that less “exciting” areas in the forests may be most crucial to understanding the impacts of changing climate.  “As a scientist I can measure that something is happening, but I don’t know the impact of it on, in this case, the whole ecosystem. And that’s why you need their knowledge,” she said.  Rosqvist hopes this research can help Sami communities argue their case with decision-makers legislating land use rights.  Back in the forest, Inga is releasing onto the winter pastures a group of reindeer that had been separated from the herd when the animals scattered earlier in autumn.  Several other herders have spent more than a week high in the mountains searching for the other half of the herd and trying to bring the animals down, to no avail.  “As long as they are forced to stay there, they’ll get into worse and worse condition,” he warned.

New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office didn’t prove the company made any material misstatements “that misled any reasonable investor,” state judge Barry Ostrager in Manhattan wrote in dismissing the case.  “Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve Exxon Mobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases,” he added. “But Exxon Mobil is in the business of producing energy, and this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case.”  READ MORE: Climate change threatens reindeer and a way of life  Exxon Mobil Corp. hailed the ruling in a trial that it said stemmed from a “baseless investigation.”  “We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change,” the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement. “Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change.”  James, however, said the case “laid out how Exxon made materially false, misleading and confusing representations to the American people about the company’s response to climate change regulations.”  “The oil giant never took seriously the severe economic impact that climate change regulations would have on the company, contrary to what they were telling the public,” the Democrat said in a statement.  The suit sought an estimated $476 million to $1.6 billion in restitution to shareholders. It also was seen as something of a bellwether for how investors view energy companies’ prospects in light of global warming and the new regulations it’s expected to spur.  The lawsuit accused Exxon Mobil of essentially keeping two sets of books — telling the public that it was fully taking into account the costs of potential future climate regulations in a warming world, while lowballing those costs behind the scenes as it made investment decisions and assessed the value of its oil and gas reserves.  The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, transportation and heat is the main source of manmade heat-trapping carbon emissions. Scientists have warned that the world must cut those emissions to stave off the worst effects of warming.  Exxon Mobil has used two different metrics to account for potential carbon costs: a “proxy cost” for predicting how regulations worldwide might reduce demand for oil and gas, and a “greenhouse gas cost” used to figure how local regulations might affect specific projects.  Its executives and attorneys said the company applied the appropriate costs depending on the situation. But the attorney general’s office said the two-part system added up to minimizing emissions price tags on some oil and gas development projects, making them look more financially attractive.  “Exxon applied much lower costs or no costs at all,” attorney Jonathan Zweig said last month in the state’s closing argument after a 12-day trial.  Exxon Mobil said it did nothing wrong, was serious about grappling with climate change and had no incentive to underestimate its future costs.  READ MORE: As water levels rise, this Alaska town is fleeing to higher ground  “We knew it was a real issue,” ex-CEO and former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson testified in October. “We tried to understand how this was going to affect everything.”  He said Exxon Mobil’s system for gauging climate risks and costs that was “as robust as we could make it at the time, and continued to try to improve it.”  The judge noted there was no testimony from any actual investors who claimed to have been deceived. He credited the company with “a culture of disciplined analysis, planning, accounting and reporting” and called the lawsuit “hyperbolic.”  The attorney general’s investigation revealed that Tillerson used the email alias “Wayne Tracker” while at Exxon, and that some of those messages were deleted. The attorney general’s office at points suggested the alias might have been used to discuss climate change, while the company said the account was just a way to streamline communications among top Exxon executives.

They recently sat down with Hari Sreenivasan to discuss their best stories from 2019 and the challenges of filming while on the road.   Read the Full Transcript     Karina Mitchell:  As 2019 draws to an end, we're taking a look back at some of the stories we've brought you this year, with the producers and reporters behind them. The team of Sam Weber and Connie Kargbo spend a good deal of time on the road with the host of this broadcast, Hari Sreenivasan. They sat down recently to talk about this past year and what's in store for 2020.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Connie Kargbo, Sam Weber, thanks for joining us. Happy 2019. Let's start with one of the stories that you guys produced with me, for me out in the mangroves of Florida. First of all, how did that story idea come about in the first place?      Sam Weber:  Well, it was actually a collaboration with several other media outlets, including the nonprofit, non-advocacy group, Climate Central.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Uh, huh.      Sam Weber:  So it was a story that they brought to us, but was a really sort of fascinating story of a plant that was making inroads further and further north because there was less and less freezes and less and less severe cold.      Hari Sreenivasan:  And we got to go out and watch the scientists work….      Connie Kargbo:  Absolutely. And I think that was probably quite the most interesting part of the story was being able to follow as the scientists conducted some of the investigations they were doing.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Each of these chambers is a glimpse into the future. By shielding it from the elements, the temperature inside is a couple of degrees centigrade warmer. By doing this, scientists can study what happens to the salt marsh and the mangrove in here at these higher temperatures versus what's outside.      Samantha Chapman, Villanova University:  What we see at least in our first six months of data is that the mangroves seem to be growing faster in the warming chambers.      Hari Sreenivasan:  The WETFEET Project is a multi-year initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation. Researchers pull water samples to measure data, including salinity.      Samantha Chapman:  It's kind of like getting blood from a stone though, right?      Hari Sreenivasan:  They use bluetooth-connected sensors to track environmental conditions like temperature and humidity; both inside and outside of the chambers. Is this mangrove going to replace that marsh?      Samantha Chapman:  Likely, yes. Unless there's a deep freeze, it's going to overtop the marsh and as it does so it's going to shade out the marshes under it and it will just take over.      Hari Sreenivasan:  And this is somewhat dirty work.      Connie Kargbo:  Absolutely!      Hari Sreenivasan:  Not the stuff that you learn in the abstract in a classroom, this is really get your hands dirty, get your feet dirty.      Connie Kargbo:  Absolutely. You're walking through mud, you're walking in some swamps. But I think what was interesting was really following Hari, to a degree, and catching some of the moments where the mud seemed to have kind of taken hold of you.      HARI IN THE FIELD:  ""Oh, lost it, lost it, lost it…!""      Hari Sreenivasan:  Right. I had that special relationship with my boot, which kept… Yeah, the foot would come out and the boot would stay. Yeah, that wasn't very fun. You were also one of the first teams that we went out in the field and took the Newshour Weekend program out to Houston. It was around a big anniversary that the whole country, the whole world was celebrating.      Connie Kargbo:  Yes. It was the 50th anniversary of the first moonwalk. And for someone who obviously, not obviously, did not live did not live through that period. It was really interesting getting to see it from the perspective of those who were alive and are now currently actually working at NASA.      Sam Weber:  And it was really hard to not get wrapped up in that getting to see a control room that they had literally restored down to packs of cigarettes, coffee cups. It just really brought home when a monumental feat. This was using the technology they had 50 years ago.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Right, because we have more in our smartphone now than I think what the Apollo 11 of the lander actually had computing power-wise, right? It's stunning to think that even in that control room, there were some of the projected images in the back, they were literally hand drawings of where this place should be. And we just take for granted on GPS like, oh, well, shouldn't we be able to track X and Y? Well, not then.      Sam Weber:  And then being able sort of catch up with a flight director today and the really incredibly tight timeline that they've been charged with to complete the next set of manned missions into space.      Connie Kargbo:  It was also really interesting getting to see some of the lunar samples. You know, we spoke with a curator there who's been kind of minding these and being able to send these samples to researchers across the country and to see these up close, to know that there are two thousand samples behind some of these screens that we were looking at. It was pretty impressive.      Hari Sreenivasan:  And the way that they actually store these, how they transport these.      Connie Kargbo:  Absolutely.      Hari Sreenivasan:  I mean, you're at the first thing like. These are just rocks. Oh wait, they are rocks from the moon!      Connie Kargbo:  Exactly. And what was also interesting was knowing that there was even more that we haven't seen, that they were just at the cusp of opening new vaults that would give us more information as to what information we don't even have about the moon yet. So that was great.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Now, one of the stories that you did is an interesting one about a slave rebellion that most people don't know about. What was this one about?      Connie Kargbo:  This was 1811 Slave Rebellion. It took place in Louisiana. And essentially, it was the culmination of many, many enslaved people coming together, planning to take over the plantations that they were part of, march in New Orleans, take over that city and form a new country free of slavery. So it was really interesting speaking with the artist who was able to kind of trace this 30 mile journey to New Orleans, which obviously they never made that.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Right.      Connie Kargbo:  So it was a it was a really great experience running along as these reenactors, 200 plus of them, walking from what was LaPlace now in Louisiana, and actually making it to Congo Square in New Orleans.      Hari Sreenivasan:  And how difficult was it to get just that, even the reenactment?      Connie Kargbo:  It was it was really difficult because obviously in certain parts they were a little further away from you. So shooting some of those scenes really hard. But what was really fascinating was how detailed they got with some of the costumes. You know, this was 19th century clothes that they were wearing, machetes, muskets. And they really got into the details of what it would have been like to wear these clothes at that time period. And they brought it to life here at 2019,      Hari Sreenivasan:  OK. And one of the stories that you folks are working on that will air soon is about wind energy. But what's new about wind energy? What's interesting about it puts it in the news today?      Sam Weber:  It's an energy that maybe we might take for granted a little bit and maybe especially for us here in the Northeast where it's maybe not as prevalent, but it's a renewable source of power that in the last decade, decade plus has really become a powerhouse. And for the first time this year, in 2019 moving into 2020 it will overtake hydro power as the biggest renewable energy source in the United States It's really an industry that's gotten a huge boost from federal tax credits are actually starting to phase out      Hari Sreenivasan:  OK      Sam Weber:  After 2020. So it's sort of taking a look at that industry, and some of the challenges that I think both energy producers and policymakers know that they're going to face as we start thinking about how are we going to make more of a transition to a carbon free future, particularly when it comes to power generation.      Hari Sreenivasan:  So where do you go? What did you see?      Connie Kargbo:  So we were in Texas, the central part of Texas. And it's really interesting because that's part of the country that also has a lot of oil fields. So it was interesting contrasting this dirtier energy with one that's supposed to be the future for the United States.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Yeah.      Sam Weber:  And it's also… one of the bigger innovations in this industry is that the turbines have gotten so much more efficient. And part of that also means bigger.      Hari Sreenivasan:  Yes.      Sam Weber:  So being on the ground at a project that sort of just getting going. So there was basically five turbines up when we were there. Out of one hundred and ninety one that will be built in online in 2020. And getting to see, for instance, these blades getting trucked in past us. I mean it's really jaw dropping to see that the amount of infrastructure and the amount of logistical work that goes into even just physically getting these things to the place, let alone, you know, for instance, taking a tower segment off of an oversized truck and carefully placing on the ground to be staged to then be lifted up.      Hari Sreenivasan:  All right, Sam Weber, Connie Kargbo Thank you both.      Connie Kargbo:  Thank you.

At the annual gathering, known as COP, the world’s largest polluters were unable to agree on stronger plans to curb their emissions. William Brangham talks to Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute about why the talks failed to achieve their goals.   Read the Full Transcript     Judy Woodruff:  Global climate talks in Madrid ended yesterday with little agreement on addressing what many say is the single greatest challenge facing humanity. William Brangham has more on why the talks failed to achieve nearly any of its stated goals.      William Brangham:  That's right, Judy. These marathon talks ended with a small compromise and an enormous disappointment. The annual gathering known as COP ended 14 days of talks where the biggest polluting nations were unwilling or unable to agree on stronger plans to curb their emissions, the very things that are dangerously warming this planet. They also postponed a decision on carbon markets, which are considered a key tool for trying to slow climate change. Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, expressed the feelings of many.      Antonio Guterres:  We are not on track. Emissions are still growing. So the reality is still nothing comparable with the commitments that we hope will be made. The reality is that emissions are growing. We reached record levels of concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, corresponding only to what we had millions and millions of years ago.      William Brangham:  For more on this diplomatic failure, I'm joined now by Helen Mountford. She's vice president for climate and economics at the World Resources Institute. And she is just back from Madrid. Welcome to the ""NewsHour.""      Helen Mountford:  Thank you.      William Brangham:  I know that this conference was not the be-all and end-all climate conference, but the evidence is growing more and more that climate change is a real and growing threat. There are tens of thousands of kids all over the world protesting our inaction. And yet world leaders just cannot seem to come to terms. Can you just help us understand, what happened in Madrid?      Helen Mountford:  Thank you very much. I think it's exactly as you say. There is a huge disconnect between what we are seeing on the ground with the kids, the protesters saying, we need more climate action, the science is clearer than ever — we need to step up and do more — and what happened in the negotiation halls, where, mostly, the negotiators were moving at a snail's pace. There was a lot of brinkmanship. We saw real leadership from some of the smaller and medium-sized economies, particularly those most vulnerable to climate impacts. They really stood up and tried to push as hard as possible to move forward to advance work. But it was the major emitters who were largely either absent or obstructionist.      William Brangham:  Some of the obstructionists, or negligence, whatever you want to call it, is some of that shorter-term economic thinking? Because we know elections are won in the here and now. And many leaders look at the state of their economy as crucial. And still, despite what we see everyday, some people think climate change is going to affect the next or the next president. Is that some of what's going on here?      Helen Mountford:  I think there is definitely some short-termism and some basically very much focused on their own interests, each trying to get the best that they could out of the deal. But the reality is, we know now that the economics are better than ever in terms of climate action. When the Paris accord was agreed four years ago, since then, what we have actually seen is, the cost of renewables have plummeted. We have new technologies that are available on electric vehicles or battery storage, which have really opened up possibilities.      William Brangham:  We know that President Trump has pledged that he's going to formally pull out of the Paris climate accords. What do you make of the argument that some people say that, in the absence of strong U.S. leadership at the table, that this is the natural thing that's going to happen, which is the other major emitters say, if the U.S. is not there, neither are we?      Helen Mountford:  Well, I think that's partly what we're seeing, but what we are also starting to see is some of the other major emitters are starting to step up and say, OK, in the absence of the U.S. at the table, we really need to do a little bit more, and we need to show that leadership. So, I would particularly highlight the European Union. Last week, they agreed that they're going to go to net zero emissions of carbon by 2050.      William Brangham:  I mean, that's a huge step.      Helen Mountford:  It's a huge step. It's really important. We have seen those sorts of commitments from some of the smaller, medium-sized economies, particularly the developing countries that are vulnerable to climate change. But that's the first major emitter that said that. Canada has also said that they want to go that way, and they need parliamentary approval, but they're planning to go. So, I think we're starting to see some of the other major emitters step up to the plate, but it wasn't really in time for these negotiations.      William Brangham:  Still missing from that list of the major emitters though, is, China, the elephant in the room, the rising emitter in the room. And India, what are those nations doing?      Helen Mountford:  Well, they're actually doing quite a bit domestically. But I think they are looking to the more developed economies and saying, look, we expect you to stand up first. And we expect you to move forward.      William Brangham:  Because you put the vast majority of greenhouse gases up in the atmosphere, and now you're saying, as we're starting to grow, hold off on your economy.      Helen Mountford:  Right. That's exactly right. They're starting to say, well, we want to see you taking action before we do so as well. I think they are starting to move, but we do need some more leadership from other major economies to start forward.      William Brangham:  There was also some disagreement on this whole issue of how to set up the carbon markets.      Helen Mountford:  Yes.      William Brangham:  The idea being, put a tax on carbon, make everybody pay for emitting that carbon, and then countries can buy and sell credits to emit different amounts. What happened in that regard?      Helen Mountford:  So, that's right. I mean, this was really about the international carbon markets, how countries can collaborate together, which, if it's done well, will actually lead to more ambitious climate action, cheaper climate action, and more collaboration. If it's done poorly, it actually could lead to more emissions, rather than less. And I think the risk that we saw there was, as they were starting to set up the rules for how to do these international carbon markets, a number of countries were pushing forward and trying to sort of add in loopholes, which would actually lead to more emissions, rather than less. And so, at the end of the day, other countries stood up and said, look, we are not willing to accept carbon market rules which are actually going to jeopardize the Paris agreement.      William Brangham:  Lot of pressure on — coming next year's conference.      Helen Mountford:  Absolutely.      William Brangham:  Helen Mountford, thank you very much for being here.

The ice fields are the largest expanse of ice in the Southern Hemisphere outside of Antarctica but according to NASA, are melting away at some of the highest rates on the planet as a result of Global Warming. (Photo by David Silverman/Getty Images)       December 6, 2019   by    Patrice Taddonio       Several weeks from now, the current decade will draw to a close having earned an alarming distinction: It’s “almost certain” to have been the warmest one in recorded history, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization .  Unveiled this week at the United Nations’ climate conference, the report says that this decade’s human-driven increase in temperatures is bringing with it progressively more catastrophic impacts on human health and society — including increased world hunger, and “extreme” weather events that have displaced millions of people.  “If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3°C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing,” the WMO’s secretary-general, Petteri Taalas, said in an announcement about this year’s report .  The WMO is a UN agency focused on weather and climate. Its new findings are the latest in a cascade of dire warnings about the current and impending consequences of climate change, including a landmark report last year from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a recent statement signed by 11,000 scientists declaring that the world “is facing a climate emergency.”  FRONTLINE has been reporting on the threat of climate change for years , and across platforms. Learn more about the science, politics and impact of climate change in five of our most recent projects involving the subject — an award-winning digital interactive film about children living in an island nation that’s threatened by rising seas; a documentary examining the political and business forces shaping America’s climate policies; a film on California’s deadliest-ever wildfire that examines the role of climate change; a 360-degree documentary that transports you to Greenland’s melting glaciers; and a text investigation on efforts by climate change skeptics to influence how the subject is taught in school.  1. The Last Generation (2018)    For Julia, Izerman and Wilmer, climate change is an existential threat to life as they know it. These three children live in the Marshall Islands, a low-lying island nation that could become uninhabitable during their lifetimes due to rising seas. “If the ice melts too much, water will bury the island. So, that’s when people have to move away,” nine-year-old Izerman explains in The Last Generation. This  interactive documentary from FRONTLINE and  The GroundTruth Project  places you in the shoes of these children as they grapple with the possibility of seeing their homeland disappear. It has won wide acclaim, including an Emmy Award, an Online Journalism Award, World Press Photo’s Inaugural Interactive of The Year Award, a Scripps Howard Award, and a Webby Award.  2. Fire in Paradise (2019)   As it unspools the events surrounding the 2018 Camp Fire — the deadliest blaze in California state history — this documentary also examines how climate change is making wildfires bigger and more frequent. “This is not a static problem. We have a problem that’s going to grow worse inevitably over the next several decades,” says Michael Wara, Director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at Stanford University’s Woods Institute for the Environment. “I don’t think anyone feels prepared for the kind of catastrophe that is possible now.”  3. War on the EPA (2017)   Since President Donald Trump took office, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has sought to delay or roll back environmental regulations involving everything from coal-fired and natural-gas power plants, to oil and gas wells, to landfills and vehicle emissions. This documentary examines how combating perceived federal overreach by the EPA became a popular conservative cause, and how now-former EPA head Scott Pruitt went from fighting the agency to running it. The film also unpacks the events that led up to the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, and explores the outsize role a coal magnate played in shaping the Trump EPA’s agenda.  4. Greenland Melting (2018)       For centuries, the enormous ice sheet covering the Arctic island of Greenland has been relatively stable. But over roughly the past decade and a half, Greenland’s glaciers have been melting much faster than expected. Why — and what does it mean for the rest of the world? Follow a team of NASA scientists as they try to find out, in this 360-degree documentary from FRONTLINE, NOVA , Emblematic Group , X-Rez Studio and Realtra .  5. Climate Change in the Classroom   In 2017, FRONTLINE and The GroundTruth Project broke the story that the Heartland Institute, a libertarian think tank that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, was seeking to influence some 200,000 K-12 public school teachers by mailing them textbooks, DVDs, and other materials rejecting the human role in climate change and arguing instead that rising temperatures have been caused primarily by natural phenomena. Learn about the group’s effort — and the responses  and  reactions it spurred – in a series of stories by reporter Katie Worth.

In fact, the decade of the 2010s was the hottest ever recorded on Earth. And although activists and scientists have long been sounding the alarm, a new voice joined the chorus recently: investment firm BlackRock. William Brangham talks to BlackRock’s Brian Deese about how climate change is altering American business and finance.   Read the Full Transcript     Judy Woodruff:  Earlier, we showed you the impact of wildfires in Australia. From fires to floods, the changing climate is affecting countries around the world. This past decade, in fact, was the hottest decade since data was first recorded. Scientists and activists have long been sounding the alarm. And, this week, one of the larger players in investing and the markets joined the chorus. William Brangham explains how it might change the way America does business.      William Brangham:  The investment firm BlackRock manages roughly $7 trillion. That makes it the largest asset manager in the world. Now the firm has announced that environmental sustainability will be a core goal. In his influential yearly letter to companies, BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink wrote climate risk is investment risk and that every government, company and shareholder must confront climate change. Fink went on to say that the climate crisis will likely force — quote — ""a fundamental reshaping of finance."" The firm indicated it will begin to move money away from heavily polluting industries like coal and into others with a greater focus on sustainability. Brian Deese is the global head of sustainable investing for BlackRock, and he joins me now. Brian, thank you very much for doing this. Because of the enormous size of your firm, you have been under a lot of pressure to push companies to take a more active stance on climate change. And I know that there's a lot of environmentalists that have celebrated your recent move. Help us understand, why now? Why did you guys decide to do this?      Brian Deese:  Well, what we communicated this week is really driven by our increasing conviction around the investment risk that climate change is posing. And, you know, a lot of the way that, traditionally, people have approached investing has assumed that the climate was going to stay relatively stable. But if you look at what's happening, whether it's the wildfires in Australia or California, floods in the Midwest increase, hurricanes and flooding that we have seen across the country, it just isn't viable to assume that stability going forward. And when we look closely at it, we increasingly recognize that those risks are not fully appreciated in financial markets. And so we believe that we are going to see a massive reallocation of capital. And we want to be ahead of it and make sure that we are taking those risks into account when we're delivering investment solutions.      William Brangham:  So, when you're doing that, how will that actually look? What is it you're trying to get companies to do? What will you guys actually be doing?      Brian Deese:  Well, the first and most important thing is being able to actually measure this risk. And we're talking both about the physical risks, so increased flooding that would affect the value of a building or the value of a company, but also the risks of the transition. And so we know that the society and — is going to move toward lower-emissions solutions. And that means that companies that are reliant on — where their business model is very reliant on fossil fuels are going to face pressure. And on the upside, companies that are competing for new carbon-efficient technologies are going to win. And so we want to understand those risks, and then we want to integrate them into how we're going to deliver an investment solution, whether that's in somebody's 401(k) or whether it's for a large pension plan or college endowment.      William Brangham:  So you want companies to think about this starting today and going forward, their carbon footprint, their own climate exposure. What if a company, if it is in your portfolio, doesn't do that? How do you exert pressure to get them to do what you think they ought to be doing?      Brian Deese:  Well, in portfolios where we have discretion, we can implement by buying or selling the companies' security. And so, for example, we have — we have announced that we intend to exit companies that rely on thermal coal mining for a significant amount of their revenue. In those portfolios where we don't have discretion, what we can do is, we can engage directly with those companies and communicate our expectations in terms of how they're going to change their business model and how they're going to plan for this coming transition.      William Brangham:  I'm curious. Would BlackRock ever consider phasing out some of the biggest polluting companies out of your portfolio entirely? I mean, that, according to many, would be the true market signal that it's time to change.      Brian Deese:  Well, look, we're focused on this from the perspective of investment risk. And so, in some cases, like, for example, thermal coal, we believe that the risks to that business model are so pronounced, that it doesn't make sense to bear the risk. As we look more broadly, we're really focused on understanding that position with respect to the transition, and this will be a transition across time. But I think the most important thing for us is to reinforce that these risks are more pronounced than financial markets currently understand and that we want to get better and better at measuring those risks over time. And over time, as we do so, we're going to take action in our portfolios as well.      William Brangham:  Again, we talked about this a little bit about at the beginning, but how much of this movement comes from the hundreds of thousands of people that we have been seeing marching in the streets, pressuring governments, citizens, governors, presidents, and corporations to try to address climate change? Was that part of the decision-making process?      Brian Deese:  Well, it's interesting. As we actually think about investment risk, that pressure and society's frustration and expectation on companies is part of driving us to believe that we are going to see this big reallocation of capital. It's both those physical risks that come from climate change, but also that society has different expectations of companies. And going forward, the future savers and the future investors are the young people today, and they have different expectations, and they are going to speak with their capital. And that's another reason we believe why we really are seeing this fundamental reallocation of capital. And that's why — that will itself in some companies performing better and some companies performing worse. So that actually has investment implication, and we believe that that's only going to increase across time.      William Brangham:  All right, Brian Deese, head of sustainable investment at BlackRock, thank you very much for doing this.      Brian Deese:  Thank you.

In his new book, “Under the Influence: Putting Peer Pressure to Work,” Frank explains the idea of “behavioral contagion,” which he says can drive people to do what’s right. Paul Solman talks to Frank about applications for fighting climate change and real-life examples in Frank's hometown of Ithaca, New York.   Read the Full Transcript     Judy Woodruff:  How people vote in an election certainly can be affected by peers, friends, family and neighbors. That's also true with some of our economic choices and what we buy. Tonight, economics correspondent Paul Solman explores how those forces could potentially be marshaled for other constructive purposes. It's part of our regular series, Making Sense.      Narrator:  The man in the middle is the hidden camera subject. He has just arrived from unemployment agency.      Paul Solman:  Fifty years ago, Allen Funt made an X-rated film — OK, tame by today's standards — using the hidden camera technique pioneered on his TV show ""Candid Camera.""      Man (singing):  What do you say to a naked lady?      Paul Solman:  In this bit, an unsuspecting job applicant arrives for an interview. Fellow applicants in the waiting room, Funt's undercover confederates, start disrobing. Sure enough… Economist Robert H. Frank calls this peer pressure -like phenomenon behavioral contagion. But it doesn't just lead to humiliation or explain the bad outcomes of mob behavior. In fact, he thinks, behavioral contagion could be a key to solving our most pressing problems, even climate change.      Robert H. Frank:  Shifts in public opinion occur very rapidly, very unpredictably. And it's because what I think about something depends on what people around me think about it.      Paul Solman:  Consider same-sex marriage, says Frank. Twenty years ago, just one out of 10 Americans supported it. Today, a solid two-thirds majority is in favor. Frank's new book, ""Under the Influence: Putting Peer Pressure to Work,"" argues that behavioral contagion can be a force for environmental good. It's an about-face, seeing as how he's been writing for decades about how keeping up with or ahead of the Joneses has been an economic plague. ""Luxury Fever,"" published in 1999, explained a decade in which house sizes doubled compared to homes in the 1950s. SUV sales quadrupled.      Robert H. Frank:  The reason we buy such heavy cars, the reason we build such big houses is that other people like us have begun doing that.      Paul Solman:  Even tiny Trumansburg, New York, near Cornell University, where Frank teaches, has its share of McMansions.      Lindsay Hart:  That was built in 2007. It is approximately 4,200 square feet.      Paul Solman:  Par for the course, says realtor Lindsay Hart.      Lindsay Hart:  That's what people want.      Paul Solman:  And why did they want it?      Robert H. Frank:  The people at the top led this charge. And they did what people do in every stratum. They build bigger when they have more money.      Lindsay Hart:  And as these bigger homes were being built, I think that pushed up the standard for the average square footage of a home and what people want.      Robert H. Frank:  So, the norm just shifted upwards.      Paul Solman:  Luxury fever, financially dicey, environmentally damaging, as bigger houses and vehicles absorb more resources to build, more energy to run. But looks, says Bob Frank, since we're hard-wired to take our cues from others, why not put behavioral contagion to good use? And we can, he says.      Robert H. Frank:  The contagion works in both directions. The rise in SUV ownership was explosive. Some bought them. Others felt compelled to do likewise. When some abandon them, the decline in SUV ownership will be just as explosive.      Lindsay Hart:  The trend is now smaller homes.      Paul Solman:  In the same local development where McMansions once bloomed, however, the latest model is half the size, reflecting a nationwide trend. Is it chic to own a smaller home now?      Lindsay Hart:  It's definitely not seen as a negative. So, I guess — sure, I guess chic would be a good word for it.      Robert H. Frank:  That's right. It costs much less to heat a small home than a big one. But the more important effect is the influence that they have on others.      Paul Solman:  Consider those solar panels, says Frank.      Robert H. Frank:  I see my neighbor put on a solar panel on his roof. Well, maybe he knows something I don't know. And before you know it, there's a nucleus in our neighborhood. We have all got solar panels.      Paul Solman:  Well, not exactly. Bob Frank wanted to put solar panels on his roof, but the house didn't get enough sun. There was, however, an alternative: buying panels in a solar farm, an array that doesn't power his house directly, but feeds electricity into the local grid.      Robert H. Frank:  I don't think I want to call myself a solar power magnate, but I own a share of it. (LAUGHTER)      Joe Sliker:  This is a map of most of the installations we have done.      Paul Solman:  Joe Sliker runs Renovus, a solar energy firm in Ithaca that counts Bob Frank as a customer. This is Ithaca here.      Joe Sliker:  Yes, this is Ithaca in the center area.      Paul Solman:  The point is, when you zoom into downtown:      Joe Sliker:  You have got one, two, three, four, five, six different customers just within that two-block area.      Paul Solman:  And outside of town, peer pressure also seems to work.      Joe Sliker:  Five all within about three blocks of each other.      Paul Solman:  And even in the woods.      Joe Sliker:  There's one customer that could have solar on Hinging Post Road, and that's where it started. And then the neighbors all tried to get it, and couldn't.      Paul Solman:  Because it's too shaded?      Joe Sliker:  It's too shaded, yes. But these customers have all put their panels on solar farms instead.      Paul Solman:  Do the neighbors brag to each other?      Joe Sliker:  Yes. Oh, it's a keeping up with the Joneses thing, for sure.      Paul Solman:  Keeping up with their economizing, too, another aspect of peer pressure.      Joe Sliker:  The cost of solar in the last seven years has dropped by about 80 percent. At this point, solar is the cheapest form of electricity that you can get.      Paul Solman:  Of course, all this depends on having enough peers.      Kevin Bacon:  The six degrees of Kevin Bacon.      Paul Solman:  Enter Kevin Bacon.      Kevin Bacon:  The idea is that any actor, alive or dead, can be connected to me through our work in six steps or less. And I'm going to give you an example. Rudolph Valentino in 1922 was in ""Beyond the Rocks"" with Gertrude Astor, who did ""Daddy Long Legs"" in 1955 with James Cromwell, who was in ""Beyond All Boundaries"" in 2009 with me. That gives Rudolph Valentino a Bacon number of three.      Robert H. Frank:  The fact that we are vastly more closely connected to one another than anyone ever imagined really is the heart of why we influence one another so strongly.      Paul Solman:  So, then, buying smaller cars or houses, putting up solar panels, will behavioral contagion alone save us? Don't we need policy as well to rescue the Earth?      Robert H. Frank:  Yes, we should charge people for discharging CO2 into the atmosphere, just as economists have said forever. What's new in the story is that the effect of doing that will be vastly bigger than anyone imagines. That's a whole area that's ripe for progress in economics.      Paul Solman:  And it's happening. Increasingly, electric bills show how your usage compares to the neighbors. And in a case of corporate contagion, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Starbucks have all recently made big pledges to cut their carbon emissions. One last question, though. If Bob Frank's own roof is panel-free, how can he be the pro-social Typhoid Mary who positively infects his neighbors? Turns out he just had to do what he learned from this story, put up a sign that he's gone solar too, with panels down on the farm, even more cost-efficient there, by the way, than on his house.

But as climate change causes water levels to rise, activists and experts are looking for ways to tackle the problems for the people who depend on the mighty river. Nexus Media’s Josh Landis reports as part of our climate change series, “Peril & Promise.""   Read the Full Transcript     Hari Sreenivasan:  One of the southernmost ports on the Mississippi River is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Nexus Media and NewsHour Weekend Special Correspondent Josh Landis recently returned from there with this report about how those who navigate the river are dealing with rising waters.      Josh Landis:  When a drop of water from Minnesota or a speck of sand from Ohio finally reach Baton Rouge, they've joined the vast snowmelt and run-off from 31 states and two Canadian provinces. The basin is more than a million square miles, stretching from Montana to New York State. During an average spring, more than 7 million gallons of water and about 20 tons of sediment pass under this bridge every second, focusing the continental force of the Mississippi and billions of dollars of US trade into a tightening bottleneck. In Baton Rouge, the river starts its final dash to the ocean, through a 233-mile, man-made channel that snakes its way into the Gulf of Mexico. Along the way, the ports of Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and South Louisiana form the greatest trading hub in the western hemisphere. Steven Hathorn is President of the New Orleans-Baton Rouge Steamship Pilots Association.      Steven Hathorn:  I believe the economic effect is around $730 billion per year. One out of every six jobs in Louisiana is from the Mississippi River. I like to say it's one of our greatest, probably our greatest natural resource.      Josh Landis:  Hathorn has navigated large ships up and down the channel for decades.      Steven Hathorn:  Our area is one of the most treacherous pilotage areas in the world. Very congested, with, tens of thousands of barges, hundreds of tow boats. We have, I think seven bridges in between New Orleans and Baton Rouge to navigate through. It can be very trying on a person.      Josh Landis:  Even in normal conditions, navigating the Mississippi is so challenging that a specially trained local pilot must steer every international freighter safely to port. But the unpredictable high water season is making that job tougher. 2019's flooding was record-setting for both its duration and volume.      Steven Hathorn:  We've had twisted anchors, broken anchors, broken chains, 10, 15 years ago. You didn't see that.      Josh Landis:  Capt. Jared Ruiz of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office deals with the aftermath of broken chains and twisted anchors.      Capt. Jared Ruiz:  We'll come out here and make sure during a high water event that these tugs are secured and they don't look like you know they're going to come off and hit the levy because if they do, that's, that's what happened during Katrina.      Josh Landis:  Heeding the lessons from that hurricane, Capt. Ruiz now keeps a close eye on parked barges. And on the city's landmark East Bank.      Capt. Jared Ruiz:  I use the sign to gauge how high the water is. Uh, well, you know, it'll be, I'll say, well, it's covering half of Baton Rouge, or it's covering all of Baton Rouge.      Josh Landis:  Earlier this year, did it cover it?      Capt. Jared Ruiz:  It covered it. It was totally covered this year.      Josh Landis:  The challenges of high water levels on the Mississippi are many.      Capt. Jared Ruiz:  Right here is where these tugs have hit the, this pilon of the bridge structure and, you'll see like the little scrape marks and gouges, you have some tugs that have such, you know, like I said, three football fields long.      Josh Landis:  So as wide as this is, it's kind of a tight squeeze when the river's going.      Capt. Jared Ruiz:  Yes.      Josh Landis:  And high water here can join forces with powerful storms in the Gulf. This spring, Hurricane Barry left cities like New Orleans on the brink of disaster.      Steven Hathorn:  Hurricane season, highwater season when you have those overlap each other, you have trouble. And there was a great fear here that when the hurricane came, it would cause the river to back up and come up, and it was already so high that it would flood New Orleans.      Josh Landis:  17 feet of high river water left the city with only 3ft of remaining levee protection. That's a safeguard the height of a garden fence against the storm surge of a hurricane.      Steven Hathorn:  We were lucky, I think it came up six inches or less than a foot. And so we were good. But Katrina, I believe it rose like ten feet.      Josh Landis:  Torrential rains and widespread flooding ambushed Baton Rouge in 2016. Submerging almost seventy-five percent of homes in Livingston Parish. The catastrophic damage reshaped the way many citizens thought about the threat of floodwaters, including Mayor of the city, Sharon Weston Broome, who is also President of East Baton Rouge Parish.      Mayor Sharon Weston Broome:  If it never happens to you, you often think, ""oh, I'll be ok, I don't need to do anything.""      Capt. Jared Ruiz:  You would go in one area one day and it would be no water. And then within, you know, hours, it would be up on rooftops. And you'd have river current going through it. I've never seen anything like that.      Mayor Sharon Weston Broome:  I thought for sure, ""Oh, it's going to go down."" It'll go down.""      Josh Landis:  Then orders came to evacuate.      Mayor Sharon Weston Broome:  Leaving that Saturday, I thought, I'll be back Sunday. I didn't get back into my house until a year and a half after that. That impact was very profound. What we now understand. We have to think about water in everything that we do, everything that we develop, everything that we build. Water has to be in the fabric of our planning. And so that's what we're doing.      Josh Landis:  In a deep-red state where talk of climate change can still polarize, Broome does addresses the issue head on.      Mayor Sharon Weston Broome:  I have learned not to debate climate change with people. I have just pointed the facts to them. Water is warmer in the Gulf. That is having, scientists are telling us, that it is having an effect on a lot of the showers and downpours that we're experiencing. I'm not gonna debate it. I'm just going to address it.      Josh Landis:  According to NASA, Earth's average surface temperature has increased more than one and a half degrees Fahrenheit, mainly as a result of burning fossil fuels. Warmer air holds more moisture, leading to more extreme rain and snow. Warmer waters provide more fuel for hurricanes, which scientists say are getting more powerful. All of this adds up to regions like the Mississippi Delta being trapped by fuller rivers and rising seas. Steven Hathorn who knows this part of the river better than almost anyone, has noticed the change.      Steven Hathorn:  I think it's probably a lot of little things adding up to get us where we're at. The river is diked, dammed, that's increased the current in it. You also have a lot of development along the river, which probably pushes the water back into it. I'm not going to discount climate change either. There's no doubt that some that could have something to do with it too. We're under the gun on that. What happens if this becomes the new norm? You know, I mean everybody, I think is saying a little prayer that it won't.

They stake out the ground and hunch down, digging up the top two inches of mud, silt, and gravel looking for baby clams.  For thousands of years, the indigenous peoples of the West Coast would build rock walls at the low tide line, allowing sand to pile up behind them, making the slope of the beach gentler, and expanding the area of the intertidal zone that clams like to call home. These simple clam gardens are effective at boosting shellfish numbers, and have long been used to improve food security for traditional peoples.  Now the Swinomish are reviving the old idea to build the first modern clam garden in the United States. Greiner, who works for the Swinomish tribe, is collecting the data that will help the tribe determine the garden’s best location. The project aims to boost clam numbers, providing both a sense of purpose for the community and additional food as other resources, like salmon, decline.  This is just part of the Swinomish’s plan to ensure the ongoing prosperity of their people in the face of a changing climate. “They were the first native community — and really one of the first communities, period — to make climate adaptation a priority,” says Meade Krosby, a conservation biologist with the University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group . The tribe’s climate proclamation came out in 2007, and their action plan, published in 2010, was one of the first such documents in the United States. “They’re early adopters and really innovative,” she says.  The Swinomish have already launched projects aimed at helping the community adapt to a shifting climate in the Pacific Northwest. To protect salmon runs, the tribe is working on the Skagit River to create better spawning beds and is planting trees to provide shade and reduce river temperatures. In addition, the tribe is fighting to block mining operations in the headwaters of the Skagit in British Columbia, which could impact waters downstream.  Another project aims to restore a healthy population of native Olympia oysters, long threatened by pollution and crowding out by competitive Pacific oysters and now impacted by ocean acidification. Workers have brought in truckloads of oyster shells and dumped them on beaches to provide new homes for imported natives ; the imports grow well, says Greiner, but so far have yet to produce a next generation of shellfish. “It’s a learning process,” she says. A site for the first clam garden should be chosen by next year. And a wetlands project is documenting the local plants that have ecological and cultural importance to the Swinomish, as part of efforts to better manage the changing coast for salmon and farmers alike.  Across North America, other indigenous communities are stepping up to formulate and enact climate action plans to protect their way of life. In 2019, the Karuk tribe of northern California released its climate adaptation plan with a recommendation to return to prescribed burning, an old idea that might help to ease California’s wildfire problems. The Tulalip tribes of Washington state are relocating nuisance beavers from urban areas back to traditional watersheds to help lower river temperatures and aid salmon populations; they are also redirecting agricultural runoff for electricity generation .  The Jamestown S’Klallam tribe in Washington is removing invasive butterfly bushes from the banks of the Dungeness River to help protect its salmon. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana are gathering and planting seedlings of the whitebark pine that are more resistant to warming-related diseases such as blister rust. Alaskan tribes are using microscopy to identify harmful algae blooms spurred by warming waters. The list goes on.  Yurok tribal member Jess McLaughlin manages a prescribed burn near Somes Bar, California last year. STORMY STAATS, KLAMATH-SALMON MEDIA COLLABORATIVE  “Indigenous peoples have always been on the front lines,” says Nikki Cooley, who grew up without electricity or running water on the Navajo Nation reservation and now co-manages the Tribes and Climate Change Program for the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP) in Flagstaff, Arizona. “Tribes have always been adapting to climate change. Now we have to adapt even faster.”  As Krosby puts it, indigenous peoples “have unique connections to the land and are feeling impacts the earliest and most severely.” One study found that coastal indigenous communities eat 15 times as much seafood as non-indigenous people in the same country — food that is being heavily impacted by everything from pollution to warming waters and ocean acidification. In the far north, buildings are collapsing and indigenous communities relocating as permafrost thaws , and traditional practices like reindeer herding are being threatened as winter snow changes to freezing rain, which locks up winter forage like lichens under ice.  “It’s happening all over the world,” says Brian Cladoosby, chairman of the Swinomish tribal community. “I have seen an elder standing on their cemetery in [the Pacific island nation of] Tuvalu and it was covered with water — they can’t bury their people there anymore.”  These are communities that have relied on the land for generations, building an intimate knowledge of the natural cycles of plants, animals, and weather. Unlike the traditional Western worldview that humanity can and should seek dominion over the environment, indigenous populations tend to view humanity as part of an interconnected whole . “We knew if we impacted one part of the web, the whole thing could fall apart,” says Cladoosby.  Adds Cooley, “We put our non-human relatives first, meaning the trees, the sky, the water. We don’t treat them as objects to be studied in a lab. We revere them.”  Indigenous communities also tend to think many generations ahead when planning how to utilize resources — a lot further than a U.S. presidential cycle allows. “America can’t even think past 4 years,” says Don Sampson, Umatilla Tribe member and head of the climate change project for the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians (ATNI), a 57-tribe consortium. “It’s a short-sighted country.”  The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s recent reports have acknowledged with “high confidence” that adaptation efforts benefit from the inclusion of local and indigenous knowledge. “One of the things that comes across really clearly is the fact that indigenous peoples are by far the most effective stewards of biodiversity,” says Krosby. “They do the best job.” One study showed, for example, that deforestation rates across the Amazon were two to three times lower in indigenous-held lands.  According to the UN Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, indigenous peoples hold or manage a disproportionate amount of formally protected areas and areas with low human impact: these groups occupy 28 percent of the planet’s land, but more than 40 percent of protected areas . In Canada, the government funded an Indigenous Guardians program in 2017, recognizing that First Nations communities are well placed to serve as stewards of the land.  Cooley estimates that ITEP has worked with representatives of some 300 of the 574 tribes in the United States and that there are now more than 50 tribal climate action plans in effect. “In the past five years, tribal climate action plans have exploded,” she says. Sampson’s goal is to ramp that up to 100 percent within five years: “We have to accelerate the ability and capacity of the tribes; we want all tribes to identify the impacts and have a plan for that.”  Swinomish fisheries managers and scientists collect data on how ocean acidification is impacting oyster and clam development. PHOTO COURTESY OF SWINOMISH INDIAN TRIBAL COMMUNITY  Sampson also notes that many tribes are making huge strides on energy independence, weaning themselves off fossil fuels to protect both the environment and their economic future: the Navajo nation, for example, long reliant on coal, has made big investments in solar power .  The Swinomish tribe makes its home in western Washington, on an island carved out by the narrow Swinomish Channel. The land is low and at risk from sea level rise: A five-foot increase this century — at the high-end of sea level rise estimates — could swamp more than 1,100 acres of the 10,000 acre reservation, including all its agricultural lands. Part of the Swinomish territory is particularly sacred as a fishing and shellfish gathering spot, says Cladoosby. “One year, just a normal tide, not a storm surge, covered up that area,” he recalls. “That had never happened before. It was eye opening for us.”  About half of the reservation’s acreage is forested, and so is at risk from wildfire, especially in a hotter, drier climate. The tribe has just over 1,000 members, many of them relying on “first foods” — from shellfish to deer — for their welfare. The surrounding Salish Sea has seen salmon populations crash mysteriously over the past 30 years; the impacts of climate change — including reduced stream flows and warmer stream temperatures — have been cited as one culprit. Dungeness crab and shellfish larvae are in some places literally dissolving from ocean acidification.  In the Skagit River Basin, a shift from snowfall to rain in the surrounding mountains is projected to boost winter river flow but reduce summer flow , drying up tributaries and making waters warmer just as salmon spawn in late summer and fall. “When there’s no water for the salmon to return to, that’s a serious problem,” says Cladoosby.  “There’ve been times I’ve been really negative looking forward,” says Joseph Williams, a Swinomish tribal senator with five children. “Things are looking pretty bleak, especially for our salmon.” But these projects, he says, are proving inspirational to the next generation, helping to bring people together. “As long as we keep our kids excited about taking care of our environment, things remain optimistic,” he says.      “For the Swinomish, as for many indigenous groups, it makes little sense to talk about environmental health and human health separately; they are deeply intertwined.”   For the Swinomish, as for many indigenous groups, it makes little sense to talk about environmental health and human health separately; they are deeply intertwined, with community cohesion and traditional food security being equally vital. Resilience to sea level rise doesn’t just mean managing wetlands, but also combating feelings of despair. Work led by the Swinomish tribe’s environmental health analyst Jamie Donatuto and tribal historic preservation officer Larry Campbell has created a set of health indicators based on these cultural values. They hope this approach will help researchers across the world think beyond simple morbidity and mortality as the only important measures of welfare.  Such work is often done in collaboration with non-indigenous scientists and governments. The University of Washington’s Climate Impacts Group last year released a Tribal Climate Tool , developed in close partnership with relevant tribes, that highlights specific climate impacts expected in local regions — from the number of hot summer days to inches of rainfall expected in coming decades — so tribes can see what they are facing and make decisions about how to adapt.  A number of such organizations are pushing this work forward in collaboration with local tribes, including the U.S. Geological Survey’s regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers ; Krosby is deputy director for the northwest division. And there’s the Pacific Northwest Tribal Climate Change Network , based at the University of Oregon, which partners with Sampson’s division at the ATNI. In October, ATNI’s climate summit in Seattle is expected to attract tribal leaders from across North America, as they work on a national tribal climate crisis agenda for 2020 and beyond. “It’s a revolution that’s happening,” says Sampson. “Watch the tribes: they are going to lead us.”  For Cladoosby, part of that revolution involves re-awakening traditional connections to the land, which have eroded in recent centuries. “Part of the assimilation policy was taking stewardship of the environment out of our hands,” he says, leaving many communities locked in a cycle of trauma and cultural loss, along with drug and alcohol abuse. “Part of breaking that cycle is getting back that respect for the environment.”  “Right now, we are taking baby steps,” says Cladoosby. The Swinomish are still collecting data, securing treaty rights, educating their own people and others, he says. Alongside efforts to adapt and ensure resilience in the face of local change, political activism is also a big part of the picture as it can prevent some development and ensure that tribes maintain control over their lands. He acknowledges it will take time to establish long-term sustainable solutions. “We live in a pollution-based economy; it is based on making money and polluting the landscape,” Cladoosby says. “Trying to change that mindset is like trying to turn a tanker. It doesn’t happen over night.”  This article is reproduced with permission from Yale Environment 360. It was first published on February 11, 2020. Find the original story here .

An apparently settled conclusion about how sensitive the climate is to adding more greenhouse gases has been thrown into doubt by a series of new studies from the world’s top climate modeling groups.  The studies have changed how the models treat clouds, following new field research. They suggest that the ability of clouds to keep us cool could be drastically reduced as the world warms — pushing global heating into overdrive.  Clouds have long been the biggest uncertainty in climate calculations. They can both shade the Earth and trap heat. Which effect dominates depends on how reflective they are, how high they are, and whether it is day or night. Things are made more complicated because cloud dynamics are complex and happen on small scales that are hard to include in the models used to predict future climate .  Recent concern about how accurately the models handle clouds has focused on the blankets of low clouds that any international flyer will have seen extending for hundreds of miles below them across the oceans. Marine stratus and stratocumulus clouds predominantly cool the Earth. They shade roughly a fifth of the oceans, reflecting 30 to 60 percent of the solar radiation that hits them back into space. In this way, they are reckoned to cut the amount of energy reaching the Earth’s surface by between 4 and 7 percent.  But it seems increasingly likely that they could become thinner or burn off entirely in a warmer world, leaving more clear skies through which the sun may add a degree Celsius or more to global warming. As Mark Zelinka of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, lead author of a review of the new models published last month , has put it: The models “are shedding their protective sunscreen in dramatic fashion.”      The debate about the role of clouds in climate change is part of a larger concern about feedbacks in warming the world.   The new predictions overturn a consensus about the planet’s climate sensitivity that has persisted for the entire 32-year history of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. All five of the IPCC’s scientific assessments have agreed that doubling carbon dioxide, the most critical planet-warming greenhouse gas, from pre-industrial levels will eventually warm us by about 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F), with an error bar extending from a low of 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) to a high of 4.5 degrees C (8 degrees F). This is known in the jargon as the equilibrium climate sensitivity.  That consensus was reaffirmed in 2018 when a widely cited review, headed by Peter Cox of the University of Exeter, found that the chance of climate sensitivity exceeding 4.5 degrees was “less than 1 percent.”  But the consensus has now been blown apart. Most leading climate models — including those from the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Britain’s Hadley Center — are now calculating the climate’s sensitivity to doubling CO2 levels as a degree or more higher, ranging up to 5.6 degrees C (10 degrees F). Their findings are almost certain to feature strongly in the next IPCC assessment of the physical science of climate change, due to be signed off in April next year.  In the meantime, the new findings should make disturbing reading for climate negotiators preparing a new deal on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to be agreed in Glasgow, Scotland, this November. That’s because the revised estimates make the prospect of keeping global warming below 2 degrees C — let alone the aspiration of 1.5 degrees C agreed in the Paris climate accord five years ago — even more unlikely.  The debate about the role of clouds in climate change is part of a larger concern about feedbacks in warming the world. It has long been clear that the “greenhouse effect” of doubling CO2 in the atmosphere will directly raise global temperatures by about 1 degree C. The physics of that is undisputed. But that is only the beginning. Things get more complicated — and concerning — because of amplifying feedbacks caused by how natural systems respond to this initial warming. None are easy to assess accurately.  One feedback is the melting of the ice and snow that covers large areas of the planet. This replaces light-reflective surfaces with darker land and ocean that absorb solar energy and then radiate it, heating the air. It remains far from clear how fast sea ice, in particular in the Arctic Ocean, will disappear. The trend, however, has been alarming, with Arctic sea ice extent shrinking by about 10 percent per decade over the last 40 years.  A second is the additional water vapor likely in a future atmosphere as higher temperatures cause more evaporation from land and ocean. Water vapor is an important greenhouse gas in its own right. Climate models estimate that the extra water vapor will at least double the direct greenhouse effect.  The third feedback, and the most uncertain, is clouds. A lot of the water vapor in the air forms water droplets that coalesce into clouds. We generally think of clouds as keeping us cool, and more water vapor should make more clouds. That may sound helpful. But things are not so simple.  While during the day, low clouds shade the planet, at night they act as an insulating blanket. Meanwhile high cirrus clouds predominantly act as heat traps, warming the air below them. Generally, at a global level, models have suggested that the warming and cooling effects cancel each other out, and the presumption has been that that will continue as the world warms. But the new model analyses suggest otherwise.  At a meeting in Barcelona last March, climate modelers first began to realize that most of the world’s leading climate models were rejecting the old IPCC consensus. The data is now increasingly becoming public. First, in July, Andrew Gettelman at NCAR reported that the center’s revised modeling came up with a climate sensitivity — the temperature increase based on a projected doubling of CO2 levels — of 5.3 degrees C (9.5 degrees F), a 32 percent increase over its previous estimate of 4 degrees C.  Others soon followed. Last month, American and British researchers, led by Zelinka, reported that 10 of 27 models they had surveyed now reckoned warming from doubling CO2 could exceed 4.5 degrees C, with some showing results up to 5.6 degrees. The average warming projected by the suite of models was 3.9 degrees C (7 degrees F), a 30-percent increase on the old IPCC consensus.  French scientists at the National Center for Scientific Research concluded that the new models predicted that rapid economic growth driven by fossil fuels would deliver temperature rises averaging 6 to 7 degrees C (10.8 to 12.6 degrees F) by the end of the century. They warned that keeping warming below 2 degrees C was all but impossible.  Zelinka said the new estimates of higher climate sensitivity were primarily due to changes made to how the models handled cloud dynamics. The models found that in a warmer world clouds would contain less water than previously thought. Clouds would thin out, and many would not form at all, resulting in “stronger positive cloud feedbacks” and extra warming.  This tweaking of the models followed recent field research over the Southern Ocean, which is currently one of the cloudiest regions on Earth. Flying through those clouds, researchers found they contain much more water and less ice than previously assumed. They were “optically thicker and hence more reflective of sunlight,” says NASA’s Ivy Tan.  That sounds like good news. But it means that past models have overestimated how much ice in these clouds will turn to liquid water in a warmer world — and so overestimated both the thickness of future clouds and their ability to keep us cool. Eliminating that bias, says Tan, could increase climate sensitivity by as much as 1.3 degrees C.  Modelers have also changed how they characterize the effect of anthropogenic aerosols from burning fuel , particularly in clouds. In general, the aerosols make clouds thicker and better able to shade the planet. The recent recalculation follows new estimates of aerosol emissions during the mid-20th century, a time when booming emissions from rapid industrialization caused the planet to cool for several decades, masking the warming effect of accumulating CO2.  Researchers have concluded from the new data that both the cooling effect of aerosols and the warming effect of CO2 have been greater than previously supposed, causing them to revise upward their estimates of the climate’s sensitivity to CO2. With CO2 continuing to accumulate and stricter controls on smog, the masking effect of particulate aerosols is bound to diminish in the future. So the increased climate sensitivity to CO2 is set to dominate, giving an extra kick to warming.      Real-world data from satellites suggests that the modelers’ predictions may already be coming true.   Real-world data from satellites suggests that the modelers’ predictions may already be coming true. Norman Loeb of NASA’s Langley Research Center has shown that a sharp rise in global average temperatures since 2013 has coincided with a decline in cloud cover over the oceans. He argues that the clearer skies may have resulted from stricter pollution controls in China and North America.  Other researchers have reported fewer low-level clouds in the tropics during warmer years. In his 2016 study, climate scientist Tapio Schneider, then at ETH Zurich, noted that climate models that incorporated this link in their calculations predicted faster global warming.  Schneider, now at Caltech, made waves last February by arguing that global cloud cover may have a tipping point, beyond which clouds would “become unstable and break up,” sending warming into an upward spiral. He used a model with a fine-scale resolution that, he said, represented the real dynamics of clouds much better than the models used to calculate climate change.  The tipping point would not be reached until CO2 levels were at around 1200 ppm, more than four times pre-industrial levels, and three times current levels. But once it was passed, he projected that temperatures would soar by an additional 8 degrees C (14.4 degrees F) as a result of the lost clouds. He suggested that such a tipping point “may have contributed importantly to abrupt climate changes in the geological past.”  This is not the first time that such scary climate predictions have emerged from modeling analysis of how clouds might change in a warmer world. Fifteen years ago, I attended a workshop of climate modelers where James Murphy of Britain’s Hadley Centre discussed how he had tweaked his center’s standard climate model to reflect more fully the uncertainty about cloud cover, cloud duration, and thickness. The resulting graph showed the most likely warming still at 3 degrees C or so, but with a “long tail” at the top end. There was a possibility — he put it no higher — that warming could go as high as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) for doubling CO2.  David Stainforth of Oxford University had done the same thing on another model and saw a “long tail” extending to 12 degrees C. They both later published their findings in Nature , but the findings were subsequently rather sidelined by modelers. They did not make it into summaries of IPCC climate science assessments. But the new, hotter projections emerging from the latest mainstream model runs suggest that Murphy and Stainforth were onto something.

But climate change likely will be, sooner or later, for stadiums where the big game is often played.  The sea and temperature are rising, posing a threat to South Floridians’ way of life, including their customary spot in the NFL’s Super Bowl rotation.  The game was played in Miami for the 11th time, the most of any city. Given the changing climate, how much longer will the region be a place where the NFL wants to bring its big party?  “In 10 years maybe we’ll still be functioning normally,” said Harold Wanless, a leading expert on sea level rise in South Florida. “Twenty years? I think that could be a problem.”  The Miami Dolphins’ stadium, the site of the Super Bowl this year for the sixth time, stands 10 feet above sea level. That will change, although projections vary widely.  Miami first hosted a Super Bowl 52 years ago. What will Miami be doing 52 years from now?  “We just don’t know how fast the water is going to rise,” said South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard, who has long been sounding the alarm about climate change.  WATCH: Can peer pressure be harnessed to fight climate change?  At some point, the time for games will end. Wanless, director of the University of Miami’s geological sciences department (elevation 13 feet), and other scientists have warned the sea in South Florida could rise by up to 30 feet by the end of the century.  That’s a first down’s worth of water, an amount so difficult to fathom that Wanless prefers to emphasize a more conservative projection of 8.4 to 13.7 feet by 2100.  And long before seawater begins lapping at the base of Dan Marino’s statue near the Dolphins’ stadium entrance, life in Miami could become less than super.  With a sea level rise of 2 feet — which Wanless considers possible before 2040 — failing sewage treatment plants and flooded septic systems could become a serious problem. Street flooding would disrupt transportation, and the area would be at increased risk of catastrophe from hurricanes.  Obstacles to future Super Bowls in Miami might surface first not at the stadium, but in Biscayne Bay.  “Creep of fecal matter into the bay is going to make the area inhospitable, because you can’t swim in the water. That is already happening now,” said Albert Gomez, co-founder of the Miami Climate Alliance, a grassroots group focused on policy. “Would you want to go to Miami when the bays are full of fecal matter? Are you going to want to have a Super Bowl if you don’t have that under control?”  Even if sewage and septic tanks don’t spoil fun in the South Florida sun, a rising sea will alter the landscape.  “Are people going to want to come to a beach if there is no beach?” Wanless said. “Which will happen. At least the beach won’t be where you want it.”  Another harbinger could be frequent flooding in low-lying areas. High tide in Miami Beach already causes problems.  “The issue will be if the hotel districts and transportation are compromised,” Stoddard said. “That’s my big concern.”  Rising temperatures are a lesser worry, although Gomez said extreme heat might someday make South Florida unsuitable for football. He pointed to a projection of 200 days above 95 degrees annually 50 years from now.  WATCH: Why climate change means new risks for U.S. financial markets  For the NFL, climate change won’t be just a Miami problem. The Jacksonville Jaguars’ stadium sits on the banks of the St. Johns River at an elevation of 3 feet. The New Orleans Superdome is also at 3 feet. The Jets and Giants play home games 7 feet above sea level in New Jersey.  South Florida is built on porous limestone, which makes adaptation to a higher ocean especially difficult. And because the topography is so flat, challenges will be widespread. With a rise of 12 feet, high tide would cover 97 percent of Miami-Dade County, Wanless said.  The Miami Beach Convention Center (elevation 7 feet) was the site of this year’s Super Bowl Experience interactive theme park. The city, built on barrier islands between Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, is already spending millions of dollars to raise streets, upgrade storm drainage and otherwise adapt to the changing climate.  “We’re at the tip of the spear,” Mayor Dan Gelber said. “We’re going to feel it before others.”  But Gelber, a Democrat, is optimistic Miami Beach can continue to host Super Bowl events half a century from now.  “In 50 years our roads may be a little higher and our pump system may be engineered differently, but we will be dry and happy,” he said. “All of this is very surmountable. We’re a man-made island to begin with. You can adapt to these new challenges, but you have to adapt. You don’t want to wait until you’re under water.”  Also sanguine is Ben Kirtman, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami. He said state and local governments increasingly acknowledge the need to reduce emissions and adapt to a rising sea.  Kirtman said the NFL could play a role with its big bullhorn.  “This is an existential threat to much of Miami,” he said. “If the NFL shined a little light on that, that would be extremely helpful in shifting attitudes.”  NFL Green has promoted environmentally friendly Super Bowl initiatives for 26 years. Projects this year included urban gardens and recycling, and the league teamed in Miami with Ocean Conservancy to raise awareness about ocean issues.  The Dolphins have virtually eliminated single-use plastics at their stadium.

This story was originally written before the Super Bowl on Sunday. It has been updated to indicate the Super Bowl has since occurred.

Special correspondent Joshua Landis reports on how local oyster farmers are coping as part of our series, ""Peril and Promise"" in partnership with Nexis Media News.   Read the Full Transcript     Hari Sreenivasan:  The Mississippi Delta is one of America's most picturesque and economically important regions. But the changes humans have made to it, made worse by climate change, have shaken up coastal wildlife and seafood supplies. NewsHour Weekend Special Correspondent Josh Landis has our story. It's part of our initiative: Peril and Promise: the Challenge of Climate Change, produced in partnership with Nexus Media News.      Josh Landis:  Debbie Fountain and her husband are oyster farmers in the Gulf of Mexico. Restaurants up and down the East Coast are a booming market for seafood from these parts. A demand the Fountains would like to harness for their small business. And they see themselves as more than just seafood vendors.      Debbie Fountain:  I feel a stewardship, you know. We're doing something that's renewable. You grow an oyster, they filter the water, you can feed people, it's a huge beautiful source of protein. What's not to love about it? A lot of these cages become little habitats, little hatcheries. See the little crabbies? And all the other little crazy things in there?      Mr. Fountain:  Would you like another oyster?      Josh Landis:  Sure, I'll have another one.      Mr. Fountain:  Salty, huh?      Debbie Fountain:  They have a complicated flavor. It's a complicated mineral mix.      Josh Landis:  But last year, the couple confronted the volatile new reality of the Mississippi River even though their oyster bed is nearly 100 miles east. Rain and snow across the Midwest had swelled the river to record levels. The Army Corps of Engineers had little choice but to open a massive 'safety valve' called the ""Bonnet Carre"" spillway for an unprecedented 123 days. The gates add a temporary new branch to the river, lowering water levels in the main channel.      Josh Landis:  If I had been here earlier this year, I'd be facing a wall of water more than a mile wide. At that time, water was moving North from the river to Lake Pontchartrain across this vast expanse at a rate of nearly 200,000 cubic feet per second. The arrival of so much fresh water from the Mississippi into the saltier coastal water of the Gulf threw off a delicate balance. Local volunteers found the remains of more than150 dolphins and twenty-three turtles. Scientists on WLOX's newscast in Biloxi, MS, blamed the loss of marine life on the influx of fresh water.      Tim Morgan:  Additional non-salt water that comes in decreases the salinity in their environment and that causes some major problems with these guys.      Debbie Fountain:  Two parts per thousand salinity. You can stick your finger in it and it tastes like fresh water. These animals are simply not made for that kind of fresh water. That kind of flexibility. For us it was 100% mortality. We lost about probably 14,000 oysters in that event.      Josh Landis:  Author and chef Melissa Martin sees the changes showing up in her kitchen. She's the founder of The Mosquito Supper Club in New Orleans.      Melissa Martin:  I created these tables so we could start a conversation about South Louisiana and talk about sustainability and food and life and the environment. What we do here is try to give people a meal that they would have at my grandmother's house or my mom's house, serving the food that I grew up eating. I get worried when I peer into the future about running a restaurant. I won't be running a restaurant based on seafood from other places. I will always be running a restaurant based on what I could get here. And that may mean that one day that I'm not a seafood restaurant. And that's a really sad thought, but that's kind of the reality of where we are.      Josh Landis:  Martin's kitchen hasn't suffered solely from the intrusion of fresh water into salt water. Salt water moving into fresh has been an even bigger problem. The numerous oil & gas production facilities in the area utilize a maze of man-made channels, allowing saltwater to invade marshlands, causing erosion and destroying seafood-rich habitat.      Melissa Martin:  Terrebonne Parish used to be one of the highest oyster producing places in the state, but once the saltwater intrusion started happening because of the oil fields, we lost pretty much all of our oyster beds. The amount of shrimp that we have has changed because we just don't have estuaries for them to live in, you know they're just being eaten away by salt water. It's a huge red flag that we've got some major things happening.      Debbie Fountain:  For us, environmentally, our markers have become some of these big disasters. A huge hurricane. A huge oil spill. A huge flood situation. I would hate to think that that's the only measures that we have of our time, but it seems like right now those are the measures of our time. We're gonna have to do what farmers all over America do. Try and insure if we can. And a lot of prayer. Because we have no control over some of those things.      Josh Landis:  Aerial photographer Ben Depp, seen in PBS's 2019 series Rivers of Life, is one of many artists in New Orleans for whom the Delta is a core inspiration. But in exploring the iconic landscape, he knows he is documenting a disappearing world.      Ben Depp:  Everywhere you look, you see the thousands of miles of canals cut through the wetlands, which caused saltwater intrusion, which killed the vegetation, and caused the ground to erode. You can see the marsh just fragmenting apart.      Josh Landis:  Some channels pre-date those created by the oil industry. They were made to transport trees during a surge in coastal logging in the late eighteen and early nineteen hundreds when Louisiana was the nation's largest producer of timber.      Ben Depp:  This place used to be a thriving ecosystem, mostly forested with Cypress and Tupelo – just this expansive, wet hardwood forest full of alligators and fish. Some areas here are still incredible, but it's kind of just the edges of what this place used to be.      Josh Landis:  The bald cypress can grow to 1,700 years old on this coast. Some scientists estimate it would require about that amount of time to undo humans' impact on the Mississippi Delta. In the meantime, Debbie Fountain offers her own plan.      Debbie Fountain:  We all have to be better stewards of what we use and how we behave and what we do. All of us have to become better stewards.

(AP) — Tourists, nature lovers and amateur scientists are whipping out their cameras to document the effects of extreme high tides on shorelines from the United States to New Zealand, and by doing so are helping better predict what rising sea levels will mean for coastal communities around the world.  A network of volunteer photographers fans out around the globe during so-called king tides to capture how high the waterline gets and where the water goes. They then upload the images — many with geolocation data embedded — for use by scientists, policymakers and even city planners as they study and prepare for the effects of climate change. The photos show where flooding occurs on specific roads, or give clues about whether it’s safe to build new housing, for example, near an eroding bluff.  “For us, the king tide offers a look at where the water will be in about 2050, about a foot to a foot and half (30 to 46 centimeters) above normal water levels,” said Skip Stiles, executive director of Wetlands Watch, a nonprofit that helped recruit 700 people to document a king tide in Norfolk, Virginia, for the first time there in 2017.  The group’s efforts have since grown into a smartphone app that uses crowdsourcing to gather images and pinpoint flooding.

A lot of the localities here are putting together comprehensive plans for sea level rise, and I’m getting calls from them saying, ‘Do you have data? Do you have photos?’ That’s what we’re going for.”  The first of these King Tide Projects involving the public began in 2009 in Australia. The idea has since spread to more than a dozen coastal states in the U.S., British Columbia, New Zealand, Mauritius and beyond.  King tides occur about twice a year in coastal areas worldwide when the sun and moon align to enhance the gravitational pull that produces normal, daily tides. These super-high tides came into sharp focus in January, when one arrived in Oregon on the same day as a major winter storm, creating 15- to 20-foot (4.6- to 6.1-meter) waves and a massive swell that sucked a man and his two young children out to sea. The woman who called 911 had been photographing the tides from her yard for the Oregon King Tides Project.  The children, ages 4 and 7, died.  Citizen scientists are preparing to document this winter’s final king tide Feb. 8-10 off the U.S. West Coast, followed by one in New Zealand on Feb. 12.  Flooding from king tides is a preview of how sea level rise will affect coastal communities — and warmer oceans and bigger storms could amplify those changes, said Peter Ruggiero, interim executive director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute.  Modeling shows Oregon could experience sea level rise of as little as a foot (30 centimeters) or as great as 6 feet (1.8 meters) in a worst-case scenario, he said.  Some of these King Tide Projects, like the one in Oregon, are run by nonprofit groups, while others are in partnership with state and local governments. They all have the same goal: to educate the public and provide a clear-eyed assessment of how climate change will affect everyday life, from flooded intersections to cows grazing in knee-high salt water, to popular beaches swallowed by waves.  “A lot of the conversation around climate change was what was happening far away and not about what people were going to be experiencing in their own lives,” said Marina Psaros, who helped develop California’s King Tides Project. “The goal of the project was to get people thinking more about climate change locally instead of just polar bears.”  In Georgia, coastal communities constantly struggle with flooding from high tides and storms — a phenomenon dubbed “sunny day flooding” in places across the U.S. South. Chatham County, home to the low-lying city of Savannah, uses dozens of sea level sensors to track tides and collect data for future city planning. It has also begun asking people to snap pictures during flooding.  “The combination of the sensor data and the photos really helps build out the story — and with that, we hope it will solidify funding decisions better,” said Nick Deffley, Savannah’s director of sustainability.  When Auckland, New Zealand, organized its first king tide photo event, people sent in images of flooded parks and freeway underpasses. They shared them with local government, and some of the images were used to develop a plan to reinforce a popular but rapidly eroding beach.

Last year, two volunteers took photos of it from an airplane, capturing striking images of swamped farmhouses, flooded freeway on-ramps, and miles and miles of salt water-soaked agricultural land.  “That flight was my first vision of homes with water looking like it was within feet of coming up into the home. And you had pastures and farm animals out there that looked like these little dots on an island,” said Rena Olson, who shot the images along with Alex Derr.  The two hope to go up again this weekend.  “Seeing that over such a large area, it really opened my eyes,” Olson said. “This is impactful.”       Left: A woman walks towards an embankment after tying her cow to higher ground during high tide on Ghoramara Island, India, September 8, 2018.

He joins the program to discuss the role of businesses in climate change.     Read Transcript  EXPAND  CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Do you think that business and these big corporate titans that we’ve been talking about, especially American ones, can and will influence the government?  PAUL POLMAN, FORMER CEO, UNILEVER: Yes, this is a very important question, Christiane, and I’m glad you’re asking it. There is no doubt that we can bend the curve with a lot of the efforts by individual citizens of this world or by corporations. But to truly tackle the issue of climate change and stay below the 1.5 degrees, which is by all means possible, we indeed need the governments. The good thing is that we have about 120 governments in the world, including the Europeans, with the Green Deal, the U.K. government that have made commitments to be by what we call net zero by 2050. It is some of the bigger countries like China, like the U.S., like Brazil now that are trailing and frankly holding the system back. A result of a little bit not addressing the issues in the first place, which has created populism and nationalism at national lever for which we, to some extent, are paying the price. I do want to point out though that in the U.S. itself, about 75 percent of the U.S. economy has put themselves behind climate action. There are major movements in this country that we are still in movement, the America pledge movement, where you see at the sub-national level, state level, city level, but also obviously with corporations, this country is moving, and actually is moving a little bit ahead of the Paris agreements. Likewise, with China, you see China moving fast, but they obviously have a challenge of still having the economic growth curve to make the country function in the way that they have designed it to be. But in their 14th  5-year plan, you see major efforts. When 80 percent of your land is degraded, your water is polluted, your air pollution which globally kills 8 million people prematurely, far more than the coronavirus, then their alarm bells ring and countries start to go into overdrive.   About This Episode  EXPAND In this climate special, former Unilever CEO Paul Polman joins Christiane to discuss the responsibility of businesses to protect the planet.

Researchers at the European Union’s Joint Research Center in Ispra, Italy, used satellite images to track the way beaches have changed over the past 30 years and simulated how global warming might affect them in the future.  “What we find is that by the end of the century around half of the beaches in the world will experience erosion that is more than 100 meters,” said Michalis Vousdoukas. “It’s likely that they will be lost.”  The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the extent to which beaches are at risk depends on how much average global temperatures increase by the year 2100. Greater temperature increases mean more sea level rise and more violent storms in some regions, causing more beaches to vanish beneath the waves.  “The projected shoreline changes will substantially impact the shape of the world’s coastline,” more than a third of which is sandy beach, the authors wrote.  Beaches are valuable for recreation, tourism and wildlife, while also providing a natural barrier that protects coastal communities from waves and storms. Many coastal areas, including beaches, are already heavily affected by human activity such as seashore construction and inland dams, which reduce the amount of silt flowing into oceans that’s crucial for beach recovery.  READ MORE: How Native tribes are taking the lead on planning for climate change  Some countries will be more affected than others, the researchers said. Gambia and Guinea-Bissau in West Africa could lose more than 60% of their beaches, while predictions for Pakistan, the island of Jersey in the English Channel and the Comoros islands are similarly dire.  Australia would be hardest-hit in terms of total beach coastline lost, with over 11,400 kilometers (7,080 miles) at risk. The United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Russia, Argentina and Chile would also lose thousands of kilometers (miles) of beach, according to the study.  Andres Payo, an expert on coastal hazards and resilience at the British Geological Survey, said that while the study’s methods were sound, its claims should be treated with caution.  “There are many assumptions and generalizations that could change the outcome of the analysis both qualitatively and quantitatively,” said Payo, who wasn’t involved in the study.  However, Vousdoukas said the amount of beach loss estimated by his team was in fact “a bit conservative” and could be higher.  The group considered two different warming scenarios — one in which average global temperatures rise by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4.3 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century and another that predicts an increase twice as high. The Paris climate accord’s most ambitious target, of capping warming at 1.5 C, wasn’t considered because scientists consider it unlikely to be achieved, Vousdoukas said.  The study’s authors calculated that up to 40% of shoreline retreat could be prevented by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change, but said that large and growing populations living along the coast will also need to be protected through other measures.  Citing the example of the Netherlands, which has battled the sea for centuries and even reclaimed substantial areas of low-lying land, the authors said “past experience has shown that effective site-specific coastal planning can mitigate beach erosion, eventually resulting in a stable coastline.”       Left: Surfers sit on top of their boards as people walk along the shoreline at sunset on Palm Beach, located on the Gold Coast, Australia April 2, 2018.

Under its Green Deal agenda, the EU’s executive arm wants to legislate to make its ambition of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by mid-century irreversible, and legally-binding for all member states.  “This climate law will set in stone Europe’s position as a climate leader on the global stage,” said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.  To establish the 2050 goal, the European Commission is proposing a mechanism for regularly raising the EU’s emissions reduction target over the next three decades. However, there is no plan to increase the bloc’s overall emissions goal for 2030.  READ MORE: How Native tribes are taking the lead on planning for climate change  This particular point has been criticized by climate activists, who claim that delaying the upgraded 2030 target is detrimental to the bloc’s credibility in the fight against climate change.  The commission only said it would present a “responsible” plan by September on how to raise its current 2030 target of reducing greenhouse gases by 40% from 1990 levels to “at least 50% and towards 55% .”  Environmental group Greenpeace voiced concerns that EU governments will “find it extremely difficult to agree a new target” before the next round of U.N climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.  A dozen of member states have also expressed their concern and have asked the commission to come up with a 2030 target “as soon as possible and by June 2020 at the latest in order to advance discussions in a timely manner.”  Climate activist Greta Thunberg, who attended Wednesday’s climate discussions with EU commissioners, dismissed the proposed law.  In an open letter, 34 youth climate activists, including Thunberg, stressed that instead of setting long-term goals, the EU should focus on emissions of carbon dioxide right now if the world is to meet the commitments made five years ago at the Paris climate summit.  Thunberg and her colleagues in the youth climate movement have been pressing governments to focus on so-called CO2 budgets — the amount of CO2 that can be emitted to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 C by the end of the century.  But scientists say countries will miss both of those goals by a wide margin unless drastic steps are taken to begin cutting greenhouse gas emissions this year. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts said Wednesday that Europe had “the warmest January on record, about 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous warmest January in 2007, and 3.1 C warmer than the average January in the period 1981-2010. Average temperatures were especially high over large parts of northeastern Europe, in some areas more than 6 C above the 1981-2010 January average.”  READ MORE: Climate change may pose a threat to future Super Bowls in Miami  Greenpeace also insists a 55% reduction target for 2030 is insufficient in limiting global heating to 2 C. Environmental group WWF is recommending a cut of at least 65% and is urging the EU to ban subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels industries as well as setting up an independent scientific body to supervise the EU’s climate change plans.  Green members of the European Parliament accused von der Leyen of giving up her claim to lead in the global climate debate.  “In the face of Greta, she is breaking her promise to present ambitious climate targets for 2030,” Green lawmaker Michael Bloss said.  To set a common trajectory and impose revised targets to member states every five years from 2023, the commission is planning to adopt legally binding legislation that can enter into force if the European Parliament and European Council, the EU body that represents governments, have no objections.  That mechanism could spark concerns among fossil fuel-dependent EU nations, which need to rejig their economies to reach the 2050 target agreed last year by all EU members except Poland.  To finance the climate transition, the EU plans to dedicate a quarter of its budget to tackling climate change and to work to mobilize 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) in investment over the next 10 years. The financial plan includes a mechanism designed to help the regions that would be most disrupted economically by the transition to cleaner industries.  Von der Leyen added that the commission started working on devising a “carbon border adjustment mechanism” aimed at avoiding a situation where EU countries reduce emissions as part of their ambition to make the continent carbon neutral by 2050, but at the same time import CO2 imbedded in goods.

       About  Series  News     A Public Media Initiative from WNET About  Series  News          Original Feature  Want to stop climate change? Educate girls.  March 9, 2020            “So… today I met my role model,” says climate activist Greta Thunberg. | Credit: Twitter  By: Marlene Cimons  Greta Thunberg, who famously missed school to protest climate change, recently met Malala Yousafzai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize fighting to make sure girls could get an education. The photo op quickly went viral . Quipped Yousafzai, “She’s the only friend I’d skip school for.”  Behind the banter was a telling truth–the battle to stem climate change and the fight to educate girls are inextricably linked. When girls get an education, they make more money, which helps them guard against disaster, and have fewer children, which helps curb consumption, and therefore, pollution. Education also opens doors to science and government, institutions where women are desperately needed to help solve climate change.  “Malala may not think about her work as being about climate, but achieving equity in education is about seeing girls–and then women–able to shape their own lives and communities, as well as the world we live in,” said Katharine Wilkinson, a vice president of Project Drawdown , a climate change think tank.     Greta Thunberg meets Malala Yousafzai . | Source: Malala Yousafzai  A growing body of evidence suggests that educating girls could have profound effects on containing climate change. Research suggests that education helps women better understand the dangers of global warming and prepare for disasters. For example, schools often teach students how to navigate a disaster, such as when to seek shelter against a coming storm.  When Cyclone Sidr struck Bangladesh in 2007, for example, Lamia Akter , then a 7-year old student, passed on a cyclone warning she heard at school to her fellow villagers, many of whom were reluctant to leave their homes. She knew what might happen if they failed to heed the warning. She also knew from her classes to bury important papers and possessions–and mark their locations with bamboo cane–and to herd livestock to higher ground. She managed to convince her family members to leave for the shelter, and everyone survived.  Also, women with an education tend to earn more money, which helps them better protect their families in case a flood damages their home or drives up the cost of food.            Students in the Seychelles learn about mangroves as part of a program that teaches children to care for nature. Source: UN Women/Ryan Brown            “If you look at malnutrition that often occurs with drought and flood, when mothers have a higher education, they tend to spend more money on their children, on what to feed their kids,” said Raya Muttarak, director of population, environment and sustainable development at the Vienna-based Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital. “Women tend to invest in their childrens’ health while men with money might spend it on alcohol. In many cases education is more important than money, but often they go hand in hand.”  She added, “Unfortunately, educating girls has not been recognized in the global climate change agenda.”  According to World Bank estimates , as many as 130 million girls worldwide are not in school. Experts say it is essential to get those girls into the classroom, as educated women tend to wait longer to get married and have fewer children . A recent report from Project Drawdown found that making sure all women can access education and health care–specifically contraception–would do about as much to slow climate change as restoring more than 230 million hectares of tropical forest, an area larger than Greenland.  “The climate crisis is not just–or even primarily–a technology crisis,” Wilkinson said. “We ought to be looking at solutions that are human, not just engineered.”            Young girls in a classroom near Mazari Sharif Afghanistan. Source: U.S. Army/Sgt. Kimberly Lamb            That being said, education is key to helping girls to enter science . Currently, men file far more patents for new inventions than women do. Experts believe that closing the gender gap in science and technology education will lead to more innovation from women, including new tools to fight climate change. However, the need is urgent. At the current rate of progress, it could be more than 75 years until women are filing patents as often as men, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.  Education also opens the doors to politics, especially where female students are groomed for leadership , experts say. That’s potentially good news for the climate, as countries with more women in government are more inclined to ratify environmental treaties.  “Giving girls 12 years of quality education is key to addressing a whole host of global challenges, including climate change,” Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the UK’s secretary of state for international development, said through a spokeswoman. “Good secondary science education brings a better understanding of climate change and a greater urgency to tackle it. Today’s girls are tomorrow’s leading scientists, campaigners and politicians.”            Young girls walk by a primary school in Cape Town, South Africa. Photo: UN Women/Karin Schermbrucker            Wilkinson agreed. “The most powerful part of girls’ education, in this moment, is around leadership, particularly among young women,” she said. “We are seeing girls and young women step into leadership in a way that we haven’t had before, and which has been desperately needed.”  Poverty, sexism and violence , however, all make it harder for girls to get an education. Parents may force their daughter into an early marriage because they can’t afford to feed and clothe her. And many families place more value on educating boys than educating girls. Often, particularly in many developing countries, girls face real threats to their health and safety.  “It often comes down to basic things,” said Colin Bangay, senior education advisor in Sierra Leone with the UK’s Department of International Development. “For example, when girls start to menstruate and don’t have access to sanitary towels, they’re not likely to go to school. Also, it’s not unknown for girls to be raped in schools.”  Governments and NGOs are trying to expand access to education through initiatives that lower the cost of schooling, help girls manage their period , and make it safer for them to go to school. Such initiatives could prove critical to tackling climate change, though advocates agree that educating girls is its own reward.  “Women and girls have a right to education,’” said Ursula Miniszewski, director of gender and equality for the Global Greengrants Fund. “There is no ‘to what end.’ It’s not a means to an end. It just is.”         Marlene Cimons writes for Nexus Media , a nonprofit climate change news service.

In the face of the very real threat climate change poses to our planet, Figueres tells contributor Sheelah Kolhatkar why she doesn’t lose hope.     Read Transcript  EXPAND  CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR: Now, someone who has dedicated her life to climate change policy is Christiana Figueres. She’s architect of the 2015 Paris agreement. She was the U.N. negotiator. And in her new book, “The Future We Choose,” she urges us all to harness our technological, political and economic potential to create long-term solutions. Despite the very real threat that climate change poses to our planet, she tells contributor Sheelah Kolhatkar why she doesn’t lose hope.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  SHEELAH KOLHATKAR: So, there’s a sense right now that we are in something of an environmental freefall.  CHRISTIANA FIGUERES, CO-AUTHOR, “THE FUTURE WE CHOOSE: SURVIVING THE CLIMATE CRISIS”: Crisis, maybe?  KOLHATKAR: Crisis is a good way of putting it.  (LAUGHTER)  KOLHATKAR: Just at the moment when things seem really dire and urgent, it feels, at least from the outside, that policy decisions, global cooperation, all of that is sort of moving backwards. What are the odds that we can turn things around in time?  FIGUERES: Well, interestingly enough, the odds right now are 50/50. That’s what makes this a very exciting moment, because we have 50 percent probability of actually walking down the crisis path onto, honestly, irreversible damages that we will never be able to control and that are life-threatening for the human species, without any exaggeration. But we also have 50 percent probability of actually doing something completely different. And that’s the excitement of the moment, because, collectively, not individually, but, collectively, we can decide to choose a better path, to write a future that we really want, and that we can look forward to. That’s the exciting moment. Can you believe it? We are right at the crossroads of humanity having the possibility to go one way or the other. Well, guess which way we have to go? Only the positive way.  (LAUGHTER)  KOLHATKAR: You mention two dates in your book–  FIGUERES: Yes.  KOLHATKAR: — 2030 and 2050. What’s the significance of these two years?  FIGUERES: By the end of this decade, by 2030, we have to have achieved a reduction of 50 percent of our current level of greenhouse gas emissions. And if we do that, then we stand a very good chance of creating a fantastic world. If we don’t, we basically have closed the door to anything that we could possibly control or influence over natural disasters that will completely take over. And the ultimate consequences of this very evident by 2050. But we can’t wait until 2050 to decide that. It has to be now.  KOLHATKAR: Ten years is not very far away. A lot has to happen in 10 years. And I feel like I blink and a year has gone by. So how is this going to happen so quickly?  FIGUERES: The fact is that, as wonderful human beings that we are, we tend to overestimate what we can do in the short-term. I don’t know what your to-do list looks like every day, but mine is always way longer than I can possibly get to. And we really tend not to have a realistic sense of what we can do in the short term, because we overestimate that. Also, we underestimate what we can do in the midterm, so we underestimate what we are capable of doing in 10 years. And technology has come so far so fast. The fact is that we are living in the moment of the most accelerated technological and policy shifts and financial shifts that we have ever witnessed as a human race. This is no longer a linear progression. This is now exponential. And we have to understand that, because we are in the low levels of that curve, but it is going to be exponential, the transformation that we are capable of having. Hence, we can achieve much more in 10 years than we can possibly conceive of right now. That’s the good news.  KOLHATKAR: You outline two possible scenarios for life on Earth in 2050. The first scenario is what we will end up with if we continue on the current path, not really changing our environmental policies at all, perhaps chipping away a bit around at the edges. Could you describe a little bit what that world would look like, if we just continued laissez-faire on the path that we’re on?  FIGUERES: So, in the year 2050, if we do not do what we have to do by the human race, we will walk out of our homes, and we will not be able to walk down the street without putting a mask on, because the air is going to be so polluted that it will be life-threatening. We will not be able — because of heat, we will not be able to exercise or play outside. We will have to do all of that inside very large gyms that we will have to build. It is a world in which we will have much more prevalent diseases, because we will have much more dengue, we will have much more malaria. We will certainly have much more asthma, all kinds of respiratory diseases, all kinds of heart diseases that come from air pollution. And we will have a huge public health bill. This is a world in which we will look at the news every day, and we will see millions of people migrating away from their homes because they do not have enough water, they do not have enough food, they do not have the environmental conditions to make their home habitable. They will be forced to migrate. And there will be millions of people migrating away from their homes. And we will have military protection at many borders of countries. That will produce a social, political and economic pressure that will unseat most democracies in the world. The social and political consequences of unabated climate change are only beginning to be felt. So are the biodiversity consequences. Australia has already lost 20 percent of its territory, burned down, one billion animals burned in — burned alive. This is not farfetched. This is what science is very clearly putting out to us to contemplate this, not as a possibility, but, rather, as the path that we are walking toward. So, this is no exaggeration. This is not a hyperbole. This is the world that we would get to, which is not a world that you and I want for our children or our grandchildren.  KOLHATKAR: So, what’s the best-case scenario?  FIGUERES: The world that we do want is a world in which we walk out of our homes and the air is fresh and moist. It almost feels like we are walking in a forest, because, very likely, that’s what we’re doing, because our cities have been planted with just an unlimited number of trees, bushes, flowers, vegetable gardens. The rooftops are producing either vegetables or flowers. We have many, many more trees, and we have very few cars. So, the parking spaces, those ugly buildings that we used to have as parking, they have actually been converted into green areas or into battery-charging stations. And the walls, the vertical walls of buildings that used to be, you know, not very attractive cement have actually all been transformed into either solar energy-gathering areas or they’re completely covered with verdant vines. So, we have a very different city experience that is actually much more enjoyable. And if we go to developing countries, the 800 million people who today in developing countries have no access to electricity, hence, they’re in extreme poverty, they would all have electricity in their homes. Every person would have electricity. That means that children will be able to study at night. It means that women can stay home and have a little cottage industry, and it also means that clinics, no matter how remote they are, they will have a little refrigerator where they can keep medicines refrigerated, and women can have safe births. That’s a very different world.  KOLHATKAR: I’m going to ask you to read a short little passage from your book, “The Future We Choose.”  FIGUERES: OK.  KOLHATKAR: I have circled it there.  FIGUERES: “Optimism is not soft. It is gritty. Every day brings dark news, and no end of people tell us that the world is going to hell. To take the low road is to succumb. To take the high road is to remain constant in the face of uncertainty. “That we may be confronted by barriers galore should not surprise anyone. That we may see worsening climate conditions in the short term should also not surprise us. We have to elect to boldly persevere. With determination and utmost courage, we must conquer the hurdles in order to push forward.”  KOLHATKAR: Gritty optimism.  FIGUERES: Gritty optimism. I also call it stubborn optimism, because it is a little bit more provocative.  (LAUGHTER)  KOLHATKAR: When you were appointed to lead the group at the U.N. that ultimately created the Paris agreement, you initially said you never thought it would happen in your lifetime. Yet, in 2015, 195 countries unanimously agreed to adopt this agreement. You describe a moment with the green gavel going down. What was it like? How did it feel at that moment?  FIGUERES: Well, I have to say that, when I walked out of that press conference — and, today, I’m trying to find out who was the brilliant journalist who asked me that very provocative question, because he did. And I do remember it was a male. He said, do you think a global agreement would ever be possible? And I said, not in my lifetime. And you know what, Sheelah? I walked out of that press conference a changed person, a completely changed person, because I realized that, while I had uttered the zeitgeist of the moment, the complete lack of confidence and the despair and the grief about not being able to agree collectively on a path forward in climate, I also realized that is com — that is a reality that we cannot allow to happen. That is a reality that has such cataclysmic consequences on the future of humanity and of the planet, that it’s not something that can happen on our watch. And so I walked out of that press conference determined to prove myself wrong and to begin to inject the world with a sense of confidence that, yes, this is very complicated, yes, it’s costly, yes, there are many different political positions on this. But, above all of it, it is the right thing to do. And we have the capacity, we have the ingenuity, we have the creativity, we have the finance, we have the technology. We know what the policies are. We can bring all of this together to co-create a very different reality. And that’s what we injected into the Paris agreement. That, you know, optimism, which is a choice — it is not the result of having achieved something. For us, optimism is a strategy. It is the input with which we actually face any challenge. If we don’t believe that we can actually succeed at something, the only guarantee is that we will fail.  KOLHATKAR: In 2016, the U.S. had a very consequential presidential election. And President Trump issued a formal notice that the U.S. is going to withdraw from the Paris agreement.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord.  (APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  KOLHATKAR: And when he was announcing this, he said: “The Paris accord will undermine the U.S. economy and it puts the U.S. at a permanent disadvantage.” And he’s since said that the livelihoods and the employment opportunities for people who live in Ohio and Pennsylvania are more important than a global climate change agreement. What are the implications of that? That seems like a major setback, no?  FIGUERES: The sad thing is — and I’m not a U.S. citizen, but I am deeply saddened by the fact that the current position of the U.S. administration actually takes the United States out of the race into the 21st century. And it opens up the space for other economies, namely, China, to be the decisive country in investing in wind energy technology and solar technology, battery development, in electric cars, because they understand that that’s what is going to make them competitive. They understand that that’s where growing demand is coming from. And want to be ready to serve as a market that is growing exponentially. So it’s very sad that the White House cannot see that that is in the interests of the United States. Now, fortunately, 65 percent of the United States’ economy continues to decarbonize, for two reasons. One, they happen to know that they live in a democracy and that, eventually — we don’t know when — but there will be different opinion in the White House. And as soon as that occurs, the United States will dovetail back into the Paris agreement very quickly, because most people understand that this is in the interest of the United States. It’s very sad when you see leadership in the United States leading people down a dead-end road.  KOLHATKAR: You talk a lot about personal responsibility and optimism. But it’s hard sometimes, when you look at the bigger picture, to feel like reducing the use of straws or taking public transportation, rather than driving, is really going to make a difference, when these major policy decisions are being made that completely fly in the face of reducing fossil fuel consumption. So, how are individuals supposed to continue to feel responsible and like they can do something, they can make a difference, when our policy-makers and our leaders in major polluting countries are not following the same thinking?  FIGUERES: Well, we first have to remember that there is no such thing as an impersonal corporation or an impersonal government. I hate to break the news, but governments are made out of individuals. I hate to break the news, but corporations are composed of individuals. And so it all comes down to the individual mind-set. I cannot tell you how many CEOs of major oil and gas companies — and I work with many of them — tell me that they’re already on the path to a transformation because their 13-year-old daughter comes home every night and says, dad, what are you doing about my future? This is about individual choices. It is about individual responsibility. Another example, plastic straws, because you mentioned that, Sheelah. How quickly did that image of a turtle with a plastic straw through its nose go virally around the world? And that totally changed our concept of using a plastic straw. Now, because of that change in individual behavior,because most of us decided, right, that’s it, no more plastic straws, so what has happened with that individual behavior that became very quickly a collective behavior? First, those who pollute — who produce plastic straws are not investing anymore into plastic straws. There are many new companies that are actually producing jobs and economic growth by producing alternatives. In Costa Rica, my country, we’re producing straws out of avocado seeds, to one have one example, or metal straws. But you have many industries that have grown up, many companies that have grown up because of the new demand. That was not a regulated demand. I have yet to see a policy or a law that goes through in any country that says, thou shalt not use a plastic straw. That transformation came through because of individual choice, responsible choice. And we have to remember that those choices that we make as individuals do trickle up. They trickle up to corporations. They trickle up to governments.  KOLHATKAR: Your father was a three-time president in Costa Rica, a transformational leader in that country. He eliminated Costa Rica’s military, among many other things. What did you learn from him?  FIGUERES: I learned many things from my fantastic father. Among them, I learned that the purpose of our life is service to the common good. And for him, that was the nation. For me, it’s the planet. But it’s the same principle. That is the north toward which we guide our lives. I also learned from him to be incredibly stubborn when it comes to the common good. We do not compromise. Once we have put out a target, a destination that we know is aligned with the common good, and, frankly, on the right side of history, like he did, and like we’re doing now in the planet, then we stop at nothing. We stop at nothing, because we have to be able to turn over any stone that is in the way, because some things are just more important than our personal little issues.  KOLHATKAR: This work is clearly very personal to you. Is there anything you would like to be able to say in the future to your children, to future generations about what happened during this period of time?  FIGUERES: Sheelah, you’re going to kill me with that question, because whenever I speak about kids, I can’t contain it.  KOLHATKAR: There’s a very moving passage towards the end of your book that maybe–  FIGUERES: Can you read it instead, because, honestly, it’s just too much?  KOLHATKAR: “When the eyes of our children and their children look straight into ours and they ask us, what did you do, our answer cannot just be that we did everything we could. It has to be more than that. There is really only one answer. We did everything that was necessary.”  FIGUERES: And in the difference between those two lies humanity’s destiny.  KOLHATKAR: Christiana Figueres, thank you so much for being here.  FIGUERES: Thank you.   About This Episode  EXPAND Austan Goolsbee explains how coronavirus is affecting the global economy.

New York's attorney general is suing Exxon Mobil, accusing the company of defrauding shareholders. Above, an Exxon refinery in St. Bernard Parish, La., is seen in 2015.
In only the second climate change trial in the U.S., Exxon Mobil goes to court Tuesday accused of defrauding shareholders and the public. New York's attorney general brought the suit, which alleges that the oil giant misrepresented how carbon regulation would affect the company's financial outlook.
The case goes back to 2015, when stories by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times found that while Exxon's scientists were inwardly researching climate change to plan its operations, the company was outwardly casting doubt on global warming.
Those reports spurred investigations in New York and Massachusetts, which may file its own suit. ""There's nothing wrong with advocating for your own company. What you're not allowed to do is commit fraud,"" then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told PBS NewsHour.
The case is before the New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan and is being prosecuted by Letitia James, who was elected state attorney general last year.
New York argues that Exxon used two different ways to calculate carbon costs and wasn't clear when it was using one or the other.
""Exxon provided false and misleading assurances that it is effectively managing the economic risks posed to its business by the increasingly stringent policies and regulations that it expects governments to adopt to address climate change,"" the state wrote in a complaint last year.
""Instead of managing those risks in the manner it represented to investors,"" it says, ""Exxon employed internal practices that were inconsistent with its representations, were undisclosed to investors, and exposed the company to greater risk from climate change regulation than investors were led to believe.""
The lawsuit claims that this had the effect of making Exxon's assets appear more secure than they really were, which in turn affected its share price and defrauded investors.
That would be a violation of a New York statute known as the Martin Act, which grants the state's attorney general the authority to pursue investigations and actions against those it suspects of securities fraud. It's the same law that has been used by previous attorneys general in the state to bring charges against big financial firms.
""There's not a general law, for better or worse, against lying in general, but there is a law against lying to shareholders,"" says Michael Gerrard, a professor at Columbia Law School and director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
He says one focus in the case will be Exxon's investment in the carbon-intensive Canadian oil sands, a project that some investors worried won't make financial sense under tougher climate regulations.
While the details get a little wonky, the case could have big consequences.
""This is the first case on alleged securities fraud about climate change ever to go to trial,"" Gerrard says. ""Many others have tried to bring such cases, but this is the first one that has gotten this far.""
He notes that Exxon fought for years to prevent the case from reaching trial.
Exxon says the lawsuit is politically motivated and driven by anti-fossil fuel activists. The company says it was honest with shareholders about how it calculated carbon costs.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey sent a letter to Exxon on Oct. 10 stating her intent to pursue an action against the company for violations of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Bloomberg first reported the letter last week.
Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil and other oil companies face a growing number of lawsuits that seek financial help in coping with climate-driven floods, drought and heat.
The New York case may ease the path for those other cases. Because New York's Martin Act allows for broad pretrial discovery, Exxon had to turn over hundreds of thousands of pages of documents to the attorney general's office, ""and their complaint reflects that level of detail,"" Gerrard says.
The case goes before Justice Barry Ostrager, who has limited the trial to three weeks and said he'll issue a decision within a month after that. It could feature one very prominent witness: Rex Tillerson, who was chief executive of Exxon before becoming secretary of state in the Trump administration.

The ocean (right) and the lagoon (left) are separated by a thin strip of land in Funafuti, Tuvalu. The small South Pacific island nation is striving to mitigate the effects of climate change. Tuvalu's 11,000 inhabitants see effects such as rising sea levels in their daily life.
In recent weeks, children marched, nations made promises and teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg scolded world leaders for ""failing us."" But while one of the groups most vulnerable to climate change, the Pacific Islands, may have received fewer headlines, it was among those making the strongest calls for action.
Pacific Island government officials in New York for the United Nations session and environmental conferences earlier this week and last week appeared more unified than at previous events in their push for greater international help, participants say.
""We need resources. We need support,"" Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine told NPR's Morning Edition. ""We need everyone on board, and not everyone is on board at this point.""
Their message comes at a time when scientists have cranked up the alarm for nations to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions and work toward mitigating impacts from the climate crisis.
A new report by an expert U.N. climate panel said the oceans are warming and sea ice and glaciers are melting much faster than previously thought, meaning storms will be more severe and frequent and sea levels will rise sooner. And for the first time, the panel projected that some island nations could become ""uninhabitable.""
""It's adding to their urgency,"" said Victoria Keener, a climate change research fellow at the East-West Center in Honolulu. The Pacific Islands ""really pulled together to say, 'We're all in this together.' ""
The Pacific Islands include a broad geographical area. Many experts focus on about a dozen countries including Fiji, Vanuatu and the Federated States of Micronesia identified as particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters.
""I see the sea getting higher""
Warming oceans, sea-level rise and more intense weather events like cyclones and droughts are already realities for countries in the region. Marine life and coral are dying off. Wildlife on the islands are seeking higher elevation. Saltwater is intruding into farms, prompting farmers to move their crops inland.
""I see the sea getting higher as the coastal areas are eaten away,"" said Claire Anterea, 41, a climate activist in Kiribati. It's a country of just over 110,000 people living on atolls that dot the central Pacific.
""My family's home floods throughout the year,"" Anterea told NPR in an email. 
In the Solomon Islands, coastal erosion has been severe, stripping away at coconut plantations and even graveyards, according to the country's environment minister, Melchior Mataki.
His government is looking at regional migration plans. ""Relocation is often perceived as a last option,"" Mataki said. ""Yet for some parts of our country, it is the only reasonable and sustainable option.""
Piecemeal promises
The U.N. said more than 60 countries promised to reduce their net carbon emissions to zero by 2050, but the biggest emitters — China, the United States and India — were not on the list.
Although polls show a strong majority of Americans believe human activity is fueling climate change, President Trump has dismissed mainstream climate science and promised to pull the country out of the 2015 Paris climate accord, saying it hurt the American job market.
While some world leaders, institutions and philanthropists pledged billions of dollars in new funding to help countries cope with the effects of climate change, researchers say it is far from enough, as NPR's Goats and Soda blog reported.
Countries such as India and New Zealand pledged assistance to Pacific Islands. Meanwhile, a group of island nations in the Global Island Partnership launched an online network to monitor each country's progress toward the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and to hold one another accountable.
""What the islands need in addition to adaptation assistance are strong commitments and real action from the countries that are the biggest emitters,"" Keener, with the East-West Center, wrote in an email to NPR after the U.N. General Assembly ended earlier this week.
Micronesian President David W. Panuelo was upbeat, however, after the events in New York. ""We felt we were heard by the global community,"" he said in a phone interview.
He said he is particularly encouraged by the attention paid by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. He also pointed a resolution passed in August to enhance U.N. cooperation with a group called the Pacific Islands Forum, which aims to ""build resilience to extreme weather in the region.""
""Guterres is very genuine about his concern,"" Panuelo said.
He wishes the U.S., which he called his nation's closest ally, would return to the Paris agreement, he said.
Last month, two Pacific Island nations, Solomon Islands and Kiribati, switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to mainland China. Both countries cited China as a better partner for them to reach their development goals. President Taneti Mamau of Kiribati also pointed out that China has stuck with the Paris agreement.
""They are serious about it,"" he said.

** How Climate Change And Flash Flooding Is Affecting Communities ... **

* https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768373866/how-climate-change-and-flash-flooding-is-affecting-communities-across-the-countr *



      Rebecca Hersher
    

Climate change is driving deadly flash flooding across America. In one Maryland town, back-to-back flooding has forced residents to make huge decisions about how their community will adapt.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: 
Now a story about what happens when climate change hits Main Street. NPR's Rebecca Hersher has spent the last year visiting a small community in Maryland that's facing an existential threat from flash floods. It's called Ellicott City, and she has watched as the people who live and work on the town's main street have struggled to save the place they love before it's too late.
REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: No matter which way you come when you drive into old Ellicott City in Maryland, you have to go down a long, long hill with rivers on all sides. And when you get to the bottom, the rivers converge around Main Street, and then they dip down and go under the buildings. The original buildings down here were mills. Now there's about half a mile of restaurants and boutiques that are much more charming because you can hear the water as you window-shop. It's a small place, the kind of neighborhood where most interactions happen face-to-face and neighbors tend to be friends. Like, for the last 30-something years, the best way to catch up with Sally Tennant was to just walk into her store Discoveries, which I've done a lot in the last year.
We're back.
SALLY TENNANT: Yeah.
HERSHER: How are you doing?
TENNANT: OK.
HERSHER: If you talk to Sally for more than, like, five minutes, she'll tell you what I now think of as the motto of historic Ellicott City.
TENNANT: It's one of the best cities in the state of Maryland, a great destination for people all over the nation.
HERSHER: Ellicott City feels special to the people who live there, which is why what's happening there is so scary. Ellicott City is getting extreme rain.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Just incredible amounts of rain in the Ellicott City area...
RACHEL SMITH: I think the rain started around 6.
HERSHER: In July 2016, Rachel Smith had just graduated from high school, and she was working at a coffee shop on Main Street called Bean Hollow.
SMITH: So it started raining, and - no big deal. And then we see the water going down the street start to get a little bit higher until it's up to the curb of the sidewalk.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Oh, my God.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #1: Ma'am, what's going on?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We are at Bean Hollow in old Ellicott City on Frederick Road. The water is above the door. It's coming in the building. We need somebody to come in.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #1: What's your address?
HERSHER: It happened fast - like, 15 minutes - for Main Street to go from wet to a raging river.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #2: Howard County 911.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes. Hi. This is the Phoenix Emporium.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #2: Yes.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #1: We are currently underwater, and I have about 15 to 30 people in here, and we are trapped inside.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: There's people in the water.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Oh, my God.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Oh, my God. Get out.
SMITH: I remember telling the 911 operator that the floor was buckling...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SMITH: It's buckling.
...And that we didn't have a place to go.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #1: What's going on?
SMITH: We were afraid the place we were going to go was down.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SMITH: (Screaming).
We just didn't know what to do.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #1: What's happening, ma'am?
HERSHER: Finally, they found a set of stairs and a closet in the back and were able to get out, but the coffee shop and dozens of other businesses were gutted. And when the water went down, the police found out that two people who had been driving when the flood started had been swept away. Their bodies were found the next day more than two miles downstream.
ANGIE TERSIGUEL: It was horrifying.
HERSHER: Angie Tersiguel and her husband own a restaurant on Main Street. The kitchen was in shambles - every chair in the dining room, the carpet, the entire wine cellar.
TERSIGUEL: I look back on that time, and I think, God, we were really tested - like, really tested.
HERSHER: It was kind of hard to even comprehend what had happened - 8 feet of white water in the street. For the next few weeks, to get to her building, Angie had to walk by a cute little bridge stuffed underneath with cars and gutters and dumpsters. But there was also a clarity after the flood. The storm had been an act of God, a crazy thing, a thousand-year flood. It wouldn't happen again. So everyone - business owners, residents, even the governor of Maryland - seemed focused on the same thing - getting back to normal as quickly as possible.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ALLAN KITTLEMAN: It's been 13 days since the devastating flood.
HERSHER: Allan Kittleman was the county executive at the time, the closest thing the town has to a mayor.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KITTLEMAN: Ellicott City will be rebuilt, Ellicott City will be reopened, and Main Street will continue to be a vibrant town for many, many decades to come. OK.
HERSHER: And it worked.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: A major announcement for downtown Ellicott City 10 weeks after the devastating floods killed two people and washed away homes and businesses - tomorrow Main Street will be open for business.
TERSIGUEL: There was a very short period of time that I could look back and think, like, wow. We did that. Like, we persevered. And I don't feel that way anymore (laughter).
HERSHER: No?
TERSIGUEL: No.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Torrential rain sent water rushing into Ellicott City yesterday for the second time in less than two years.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #3: Howard County 911. What's the location of your emergency?
HERSHER: Newly repaired windows were smashed; newly repaved sidewalks, washed away.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: God, this is worse than the last one.
HERSHER: National Guardsman Eddison Hermond was hanging out at a bar on Main Street when he saw a woman struggling in the water. He stepped out to help her.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: There was a gentleman that was trying to cross over the Tiber River location.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #4: In a vehicle?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: No, himself.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #4: OK. What happened?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: He got swept under.
UNIDENTIFIED OPERATOR #4: What did he look like?
HERSHER: It took two days to find Hermond's body downstream.
ANJEL SCARBOROUGH: My organist is practicing the Charles...
HERSHER: At the end of Main Street is a church, St. Peter's. Reverend Anjel Scarborough led the congregation in the weeks after the second deadly flood. The church is up on high ground, so it was a place that everyone came for cleanup supplies, for food, for someone to talk to.
SCARBOROUGH: There was such shock. I mean, it really was the shock of - this can't be happening again. This - you know, there's such denial in the initial stages. But then it was the mourning and the grieving of the, you know, the can-do attitude that - no, we can't go back and do this again. We have to face the hard reality that we have to let go of our life here, you know?
HERSHER: We have to let go of our life here. The second flood had cracked apart the town's veneer of safety. It felt dangerous. In the weeks after the flood, the county leader Allan Kittleman called a town meeting in the high school auditorium and said something extraordinary - I was wrong.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KITTLEMAN: For 246 years, the people of Ellicott City have said, we know better than the river, and we can impose ourselves on the river, and we'll make it work for us. And frankly, I was a believer in that until this flood.
HERSHER: Kittleman had been leading the charge to rebuild just 22 months earlier. Now, he said, the town needed a new plan.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KITTLEMAN: Frankly, now I've realized that we can try all we can do impose ourselves on this river and these streams, but the water doesn't listen, and we need to decide how we can coexist with the river.
HERSHER: And then Kittleman announced a plan for saving Ellicott City. It had been developed using the best hydrological model available, and the plan had three parts. First, temporarily stop building homes and businesses up on the ridges around Main Street to control runoff. Second, build new retention ponds and bigger culverts so the water that did come down wouldn't flood the road as much.
But it was the third part of the plan that would destroy friendships and pit neighbors against each other and nearly destroyed the entire social fabric of old Ellicott City. The third part of the plan was to tear down 10 buildings on Main Street to make room for the river. And this is where the story of the people of Ellicott City becomes the story of climate change in America. When the climate changes and the future no longer looks like the past, people all over the country are forced to make huge, life-changing decisions. There's no playbook for how to do it, and there's no cavalry coming to help, and if it goes wrong, your town can die.
Tomorrow on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, what happened next in Ellicott City.

Swinomish tribal member Vernon Cayou gathers clams at Ala Spit County Park in Puget Sound.
Tribes in the Puget Sound region have a problem.
Many of them live on low-lying reservations surrounded by water. So, as climate change causes the oceans to rise, tribal land is disappearing. Climate change also threatens the fish and shellfish these groups rely on for food and income. Now, some tribes are looking at a surprising solution to these problems: clam gardens.
On a rocky beach on Whidbey Island — a densely forested island in Puget Sound — John Cayou watches for the telltale squirt that reveals a clam's location.
Then he takes what looks like a tiny pitchfork full of sand and rocks, turns it over, and tosses any clams he finds into a bucket.
Cayou's a member of the Swinomish Tribe. He's 72, and has been harvesting clams since he was a little kid.
He remembers a time when there were a lot more clams.
Clam decline 
""You'd take the bucket and the clam fork, and you would go out, and believe you me it wouldn't take very long — maybe 10, 15 minutes max — you had a bucket,"" Cayou says. 

                Clams have been an important part of tribal diets in the Pacific Northwest for centuries.

But, nowadays, native clams up and down the West Coast are not doing well.
""Native littlenecks have declined so much throughout Washington's inland waters that they're really difficult to find now,"" says Julie Barber, a shellfish biologist for the Swinomish Tribe.
The likely culprit is climate change. Warming waters mean less algae for clams to eat. And more carbon in the atmosphere is also making oceans more acidic, which is bad for baby clams. That's why Barber and others are trying to build a clam garden on the Swinomish Reservation.
""What a clam garden can do is provide a place for the tribe to continue their practice of harvesting clams for subsistence,"" Barber explains.
A clam garden is a rock wall built so low on a beach it's only visible at the lowest tides. The walls are designed so sand and bits of clam shell build up behind them.
Those bits of shell can make the water around them less acidic, which creates some buffered habitat for baby clams—and other species.

                Clams used as bait are dyed blue.

""That rock wall creates a new rocky reef habitat that supports a whole different suite of marine plants and animals,"" says Skye Augustine, an ecologist and a member of the Stz'uminus Nation, from the east coast of Vancouver Island.
She says that Clam gardens can also cut down on beach erosion and reduce wave energy as sea levels rise. So these gardens would help hold the Swinomish Reservation in place as climate change advances.
An ancient tradition
""Clam gardens have been around on the British Columbia, Alaskan, and Washington state coasts for over 3000 years,"" Augustine says.
After colonization, those gardens fell into disuse. Now, Augustine is running the first project since then to restore the gardens in British Columbia. The Swinomish's would be the first revival of this tradition in the U.S.
At the annual Swinomish clam bake, more than a hundred tribal members gathered at long tables at a beach on the reservation, eating all kinds of shellfish.
""There's the old Indian saying in this part of the world that when the tide is out the table is set,"" Swinomish elder Larry Campbell says, ""because the clams are in our tideland.""
The goal of the clam garden is to keep the table set.
The Swinomish Tribe hopes that its new garden will be built as soon as next summer, in time for the next clam bake.

Climate researcher Juliano Calil helps a resident of Turner Station use the virtual reality program he created to show the expected impacts of sea level rise there.
Connie Monroe clicks a button, flicks her wrist and watches as her neighborhood floods.
The reed-covered shorelines are first to go. Then, the baseball fields at Fleming Park. By the time seawater reaches the senior center, it has inundated streets, flooding more than a dozen multiunit brick homes that she can see.
Monroe moves her head up and down, side to side, taking in the sobering simulated view. This is what could happen to Turner Station, a historic African American community southeast of Baltimore, as sea levels rise.
""Everything's underwater. The school is underwater. Our house is underwater,"" Monroe says. A frown forms below the bulky gray virtual reality headset covering her eyes. ""Is the water really supposed to get that high?""
Climate change presents many challenges to coastal communities and to those trying to prepare for its impacts, but one of the most basic is also one of the most vexing: How do you show people — and convince them — of a possible future?

It's one thing to hear or read that sea levels could rise as high as 7 feet in Maryland by the end of the century under worst-case scenarios, but it's another ""to imagine what that will look like in your own backyard,"" says Jackie Specht, the coastal science program manager for The Nature Conservancy's Maryland/DC Chapter.
""And if it's hard to imagine, it's hard to face and prioritize, especially when there are so many tangible issues that [people are] facing in the day-to-day.""
Communicating the realness and immediacy of the climate threat is hugely important to climate researchers and those aiming to mitigate its causes. But it's also paramount to communities faced with coming changes that are already unavoidable.
Climate resiliency projects need public support and input.
That's why Monroe and other residents at this recent community meeting are being directed to sit in metal chairs, put on virtual reality headsets and watch their homes flood.
Turner Station is trying to prepare.

                Turner Station, a historic African-American neighborhood near Baltimore, was home to Henrietta Lacks, whose cells have been critical to medical research. The community is at risk of rising seas.

Turner Station, a historic African-American neighborhood near Baltimore, was home to Henrietta Lacks, whose cells have been critical to medical research. The community is at risk of rising seas.
""Slogging through water""
Flooding is nothing new to Turner Station.
The community sits on a little peninsula that juts south into the Patapsco River and the greater Baltimore Harbor. To the west are the tall cranes of the Port of Baltimore. To the east, across a wide creek, is Sparrows Point, the former site of a massive steel company and industrial complex that, for decades, employed most of the community's residents.
Larry Bannerman, a lifelong resident and a board member for Turner Station Conservation Teams, says that water has always run south down the peninsula in big rain events, flooding parts of town and the low-lying, waterfront baseball fields at Fleming Park.
But not like it does now.

                Larry Bannerman is part of a community team that's trying to prepare Turner Station for the impacts of rising seas.

Larry Bannerman is part of a community team that's trying to prepare Turner Station for the impacts of rising seas.
""I don't ever remember running in the outfield and slogging through water,"" Bannerman says, walking alongside one of the baseball fields in a pair of rubber boots. Now, he says, it has become so common that the fields hardly see any use.
The county has built outfalls, structures where water can drain into the harbor, along the end of the peninsula and at Fleming Park. ""But you probably couldn't see them right now because they're underwater,"" he says. ""They're not supposed to be.""
Planning for the future
Sea level rise often gets talked about as a far-off event, but Maryland and much of the East Coast are already feeling the effects. Coastal erosion is accelerating. Wetlands are deteriorating. High-tide flooding occurs with greater frequency.

                For generations, the children at Turner Station played baseball at Fleming Park, says Bannerman. Now, the fields don't see much use because of flooding.

For generations, the children at Turner Station played baseball at Fleming Park, says Bannerman. Now, the fields don't see much use because of flooding.
A 2018 report by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science says, ""The level of Chesapeake Bay water with respect to the land is now rising about three times as fast as it was during Colonial times, threatening more densely built communities and infrastructure that developed over the interim.""
The threat isn't lost on Turner Station, which has partnered with the Port of Baltimore, a few nonprofits and a local landscape architecture firm to create a project that would reshape Fleming Park and mitigate the risk of future floods.
The project calls for taking dredged sediment from Baltimore Harbor and Chesapeake Bay and using it to beef up the local shoreline and give it a more resilient edge. The design would help offset erosion and provide added defense against storm surge.
But some in the community worry about the use of dredge material at a public park, given the industrial pollution that has historically occurred in the area. It's a worry that Bannerman and other project leaders say is unfounded; any material that would be used would first be tested for contamination.
""We need the whole community on board with this,"" says Gloria Nelson, president of Turner Station Conservation Teams. ""Rather than [an] agency coming to us and telling us: 'This is what we're going to do in your community.' ""
To get that buy-in — and to make their case to potential funders — the project's organizers are going to incredible lengths to communicate their plans and the risks of inaction.

                Isaac Hametz, a research landscape architect, explains the coastal resilience project being planned for Fleming Park to a couple of the area's residents.

Isaac Hametz, a research landscape architect, explains the coastal resilience project being planned for Fleming Park to a couple of the area's residents.
Mahan Rykiel, the local landscape architectural firm that created the conceptual designs for the project, has created three-dimensional topographic maps of the area and two-dimensional illustrations to bring to community meetings.
Project organizers have given tours at the park, talking through the planned changes.
""You need a range of tools and a range of ways to communicate [climate change] to the public, because every person is different and every place is different,"" says Isaac Hametz, the firm's research director.
The virtual reality program is only the most recent — and, perhaps the most effective, step.
Starting a conversation 
Virtual reality is an immersive experience that can trick the human brain into thinking it's real. But tricking people is not the goal of the sea level rise simulation being used at Turner Station, says Juliano Calil, one of the program's developers.
The goal, he says, ""is to start a conversation and help folks visualize the impacts [of climate change] and the solutions, and also discuss the trade-offs between them.""

                Juliano Calil prepares to launch his drone over Long Beach, Calif., for a virtual reality program he's creating to simulate the effects of sea level rise on the area.

Juliano Calil prepares to launch his drone over Long Beach, Calif., for a virtual reality program he's creating to simulate the effects of sea level rise on the area.
Calil is an adjunct professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California and a research fellow focused on coastal adaptation. He's also a licensed drone operator and an early adopter of virtual reality.
A couple of years ago, he had the idea of pairing those skills with his climate work and set out to make a sea level rise simulation for his current hometown, Santa Cruz, Calif.
He recruited a video game designer to create the models, using elevation maps, aerial footage he recorded with his drone and the most recent sea level rise projections.
""We spent a week in my living room and did a prototype in VR and it worked,"" Calil says. ""And I think that's indicative of what we need to address climate change: No matter what skill you have, there is a way that you can apply that to help solve the problems.""
The Santa Cruz program is housed in a local library for residents to use, and Calil has started work on another simulation for Long Beach, Calif. There, instead of a lower-income neighborhood like Turner Station, the area at risk is a narrow strip of expensive beach homes.  
Each project shows the communities and shoreline as they look today from a bird's-eye view. A slider at the bottom lets the user bring sea levels up as narration explains what the viewer is seeing.
Future versions, Calil says, will also integrate proposed solutions. If a community is considering building a sea wall, for example, ""we can show the sea wall and look at the impacts to the beach,"" he says. ""You have a sea wall, but over time, you may lose the beach.""

                Using a virtual reality program, three-dimensional maps and illustrated printouts, organizers of the Fleming Park Project are looking to inspire community involvement.

Using a virtual reality program, three-dimensional maps and illustrated printouts, organizers of the Fleming Park Project are looking to inspire community involvement.
Giving people a clear sense of those trade-offs, he says, should make for a better-informed discussion around climate resiliency projects, and showing people the risks should spur interest and participation.
At Turner Station's community meeting in southeast Baltimore County, Eric Johnson, pastor of the Union Baptist Church, removes one of the virtual reality headsets and blinks as his eyes adjust to the auditorium's bright lights.
Asked about his experience, he pauses.
""You hear about global warming and the effects of it, but to really be able to see it in real time is an eye-opener,"" he says. ""It shows you this is something we needed to work on, like, yesterday.""

Mangroves by the water in Mumbai.
Bare trees with slender branches line a half-built highway overpass in eastern Mumbai. These are mangroves, trees or shrubs found in tropical swampy marshland with roots that grow above the ground. But construction has blocked their lifeblood — salt water. Their aerial roots poke through dry, caked mud instead of brackish water.
Environmentalist B.N. Kumar points to a small channel under the highway where seawater once entered the mangrove patch. It's now littered with rocks and construction debris.
""All the mangroves, about 5,000 of them, have dried up. They can only be used as firewood now,"" Kumar says. ""It's very sad to see these mangroves dying like this.""

                The roots of mangroves, poking through swamp mud, serve as breeding areas for fish.

The roots of mangroves, poking through swamp mud, serve as breeding areas for fish.
Thousands of acres of velvety green mangroves line the border between the Arabian sea and the city of Mumbai in western India. They act as natural buffers against coastal erosion and flooding, and they store up to four times as much carbon as other forests. With sea level rise inevitable, Mumbai's mangroves are more important now than ever. A new report by climate change researchers predicts much of Mumbai, which is India's financial capital, will be underwater by 2050 if global carbon emissions aren't reduced. The city, originally a cluster of seven islands, is especially vulnerable. Many parts of it have been built by reclaiming land from the sea.
""At a time when we require more and more mangroves, we are destroying, unfortunately, more and more mangroves,"" Kumar says.
Studies show that Mumbai lost nearly 40 percent of its mangroves between 1991 and 2001 — about 9,000 acres. And rapid urbanization continues to threaten them.
A short car ride from the dried mangroves along the highway, a municipal garbage truck dumps trash on the edge of a mangrove patch. Sludge and plastic waste cover the roots of the mangroves, slowly choking them. In another area nearby, hundreds of acres of mangroves are being cut for the construction of the Navi Mumbai international airport.

                Mangroves (green) were plentiful in this Google Earth image from Nov. 12, 2003 showing the site of the future Navi Mumbai International Airport (left). By Nov. 12, 2019 (right), the development work for the airport had wiped out hundreds of acres of mangroves.

Mangroves (green) were plentiful in this Google Earth image from Nov. 12, 2003 showing the site of the future Navi Mumbai International Airport (left). By Nov. 12, 2019 (right), the development work for the airport had wiped out hundreds of acres of mangroves.
One of India's most glamorous infrastructure projects, the country's first bullet train — which will run between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, in the western Indian state of Gujarat — is estimated to destroy at least 32,000 mangroves.
Journalist-turned-activist Kumar, who runs a blog called The Nature Connect, has raised concerns about mangrove destruction with authorities, including the Japanese government agency that is helping build the bullet train. Kumar and other activists organized an exhibition in Mumbai earlier this year displaying large posters about the environmental impacts of such projects.
Kumar says environmentalists are often branded as anti-development, especially when they oppose projects like the bullet train, which, for many Indians, is a source of pride.
""We are not against any development,"" Kumar says. ""Our question is, does it need to happen at the cost of the environment?""
People need to understand that they cannot survive without nature, says Debi Goenka, executive trustee of the Mumbai-based nonprofit Conservation Action Trust. ""Just chasing the mirage of GDP growth is not development,"" he adds.
Authorities say they will plant five mangroves for each one that is cut for the bullet train. But activists say promises about replanting are a sham.
""There is actually no land [within the city] to replant mangroves, no suitable habitat available,"" says Goenka. On the rare occasion that mangrove restoration does happen, most of the saplings don't survive, Goenka adds.
With these mangroves gone, Mumbai will be left without a vital line of defense when natural disasters strike. And that has happened before.
In 2005, when the city experienced unprecedented monsoon rainfall leading to catastrophic flooding, one of the worst affected areas was a commercial hub in central Mumbai, full of shopping malls and skyscrapers. It's been constructed by reclaiming low-lying areas on the banks of the Mithi River, previously home to a sprawling mangrove forest that acted as a natural stormwater drain.
While floods were ravaging most of Mumbai, Nandakumar Pawar recalls being surprised that his fishing village in a northeastern suburb of Mumbai escaped the worst. A more than 2,000-acre stretch of mangroves nearby acted as a sponge to hold water and didn't allow it to flood his village, he says.
""That was a truly eye-opening incident for me and my community,"" Pawar says.

                In a creek lined with mangroves in Mumbai, boats wait to take tourists to spot flamingos and other migratory birds.

In a creek lined with mangroves in Mumbai, boats wait to take tourists to spot flamingos and other migratory birds.
As a fisherman, Pawar already knew mangroves are breeding grounds for fish, which lay their eggs on the roots. He realized mangroves were crucial not just for the fishing community but for everyone.
He started a nongovernmental group called Shree Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (named for a local deity) that has enlisted fishermen to help with mangrove and wetland conservation. When they go out to fish, they act as mangrove vigilantes. If they spot illegal activities, like debris or garbage dumping or illegal encroachment in mangrove areas, they alert the organization, Pawar says.
Authorities appear to be slowly realizing the urgency of mangrove conservation.
In 2012, the government in the state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, set up a mangrove conservation unit, the first in India. The unit helps regenerate mangroves through a variety of projects, explains former range forest officer Seema Adgaonkar, as she walks through a nursery she helped set up in a northeastern suburb of Mumbai. The gnarled roots of the mangroves rise out of damp, mossy earth and pools of tidal water.
Adgaonkar rattles off the names of mangrove species that used to found in the wild in Mumbai but can only be seen in a protected nursery now. It's part of the city's first mangrove and coastal biodiversity tourism center, which offers regular tours, including flamingo safaris, to heighten awareness.

                Seema Adgaonkar, 57, helped set up this mangrove nursery when she worked as a forest ranger with the state mangrove conservation unit.

Seema Adgaonkar, 57, helped set up this mangrove nursery when she worked as a forest ranger with the state mangrove conservation unit.
The unit also deploys security officers armed with buckshot guns along the periphery of mangrove forests. The Bombay High Court ruled in 2018 that the destruction of mangroves ""offends the fundamental rights of citizens,"" and several people have been arrested, mostly for encroachment.
But a handful of officers of the mangrove cell are not enough to save all of Mumbai's mangroves, Adgaonkar says. It's important to educate the public — especially children — about the urgency of saving these indispensable trees, she adds.
""If mangroves are saved, Mumbai will be saved,"" Adgaonkar says. ""Otherwise, as sea levels rise, this bustling metropolis will collapse like a house of cards.""

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi shakes hands with Solomon Islands' Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele after the signing of a joint communique in Beijing establishing diplomatic relations between China and the Solomon Islands.
Updated at 1:15 a.m. Monday
This month, the Trump administration formally began the yearlong process of pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement. It will be the first and only country to quit the 200-nation deal to combat climate change. That's a big concern for some of the world's most vulnerable countries, including the small island nations of the Pacific.
While the administration still promises to work outside the agreement with nations on environmental problems, Pacific island nations that consider themselves on the front lines of climate change had hoped the U.S. would stay committed to the global deal to cut emissions and help populations confront the rising seas around them.
Now some leaders of those nations are turning for help to China, and climate change has been a factor. Beijing has vowed to stay in the Paris Climate Agreement. The diplomatic reconfiguration in the region has opened up a new front in the battle for influence between China and the U.S. and its allies.
""The show of lack of leadership by the current U.S. government in the fight against climate change is very discouraging not only to us but to all the low-lying island nations of the Pacific,"" officials from the Solomon Islands tell NPR via email. ""Although China is one of the biggest CO2 emitters, it is showing leadership and commitment to help lead our global efforts against [climate change].""
An archipelago of some 900 islands northeast of Australia, the Solomon Islands decided in September to downgrade its ties with Taiwan and renormalize diplomatic relations with Beijing. Taiwan then ended its relationship with the Solomons.
Economic reasons were a key driver of the Solomons' decision, but climate change was ""also a factor in the decision to switch,"" Robson Tana Djokovic, the Solomon Islands prime minister's chief of staff, and Samson Viulu, a senior economic official, tell NPR. ""For most of us, [climate change] is about our present and future.""
They've watched their islands disappear under rising seas and their drinking water inundated by saltwater. The two officials said the Solomon Islands ""felt that we are not an important part of the global family maybe because we do not have big economies and so are not treated as important when it comes to [climate change].""
So they've turned to China, in hopes a relationship with Beijing will boost economic development as well as give their nation more resources to manage and mitigate the impact of global warming.
""Very clear"" reasons
Less than a week after the Solomon Islands' diplomatic shakeup, Kiribati — a smattering of low-lying atolls in the central Pacific with a population of just more than 116,000 — announced it would also cut ties with Taiwan and establish relations with Beijing. 
You can't avoid the footprint of China on the Pacific now — it's just everywhere.
Jonathan Pryke, Lowy Institute
""The reason was very clear,"" Kiribati President Taneti Mamau told reporters in New York during the United Nations General Assembly. China, ""as a big power with much more resources"" than Taiwan, he said, would be a better partner in tackling both domestic and global issues, including climate change. Kiribati previously had diplomatic ties to China.
China is ""serious"" about climate change, he emphasized, citing Beijing's promise not only to cut its own carbon emissions, but also to help Pacific island nations mitigate and manage the impacts of climate change and fully implement the Paris Agreement. 
China's involvement in the Pacific has grown in the past two decades but really began to accelerate after Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan panel that advises Congress on the security implications of trade and economic relationships between Beijing and Washington.
In a report issued this year, the commission said China wants to establish a military presence in the region, benefit from the region's voting power at the United Nations, gain access to natural resources such as timber, gold, nickel and fish, and undermine regional diplomatic support for Taiwan, which Beijing sees as its own.
The region is an important part of China's massive infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. According to a report last year by the U.S.-China commission, China has increased its aid to Pacific tourism and boosted the number of high-level visits by Chinese diplomats. The report also found that China has upped humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the region.
While Xi has stated that China does not seek a ""sphere of influence,"" Taiwan has accused Beijing of trying to ""suppress and reduce Taiwan's international presence"" and take away its sovereignty. The recent decision by Kiribati and the Solomon Islands to normalize relations with Beijing leaves Taiwan with 15 bilateral relationships around the world — less than a third of them small Pacific island nations, including Nauru and Tuvalu. 
A fluid relationship
Taiwan is the United States' 11th largest goods trading partner, and the U.S. continues to sell it advanced weapons, even though Washington maintains no official ties with Taiwan.
And now I will begin exploring ways to cut off ties with #SolomonIslands including potentially ending financial assistance & restricting access to U.S. dollars & banking. https://t.co/1l7YdmhWNK
In Washington, the Pacific islands' recent snubbing of Taiwan set off alarm bells and drew the ire of politicians including Vice President Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who tweeted a threat to ""cut off ties"" to the Solomon Islands.
But America's interest in the South Pacific historically has waxed and waned, depending on geo-strategic concerns, says Scott Kroeker, interim senior manager of the Pacific Islands Development Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu.
""Whenever another rival power starts to rear their head in the region, the U.S. says, 'Oh, we better pay attention,' "" Kroeker says.
Since World War II, the U.S. has kept relatively good relations with the North Pacific island nations, Kroeker says. The Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau each have bilateral agreements with the U.S. known as compacts of free association. They receive hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid and depend on Washington for defense.
Both Washington and Taipei are closely watching for the results of this week's Marshall Islands general election. The current Marshallese government is an ally of Taiwan, while the opposition is eager to work with China. The winner will head up negotiations to renew the compact with the U.S., set to expire in 2024.
In the South Pacific, the U.S. shares influence with Australia and New Zealand, with the latter two countries giving more aid money and military resources to the region than Washington. But China has ""significantly bolstered"" its economic, diplomatic and security engagement in the Pacific islands over the past five years, according to a 2018 U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report.
""Beijing's growing engagement in the Pacific islands poses a number of implications for U.S. interests in the region,"" the commission report says. ""Some analysts are concerned China is trying to erode U.S. influence in the region to weaken the U.S. military presence and create an opening for Chinese military access.""
A ""dramatically changing"" landscape
Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute think tank in Sydney believes such concerns are overblown. There's ""a really low probability"" of China setting up a military base in the Pacific islands, he argues, despite U.S. and Australian fears. Not only have Washington and Canberra become more alert to Beijing's moves in the region, but the Pacific island nations themselves ""don't want to be further militarized,"" he explains.
""They didn't have a good run of it in World War II, they vividly remember that,"" Pryke says. ""Also they are fiercely protective of their sovereignty.""
Both Australia and New Zealand have re-upped engagement in the Pacific region, along with the U.S. In recent months, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Micronesia and met with President David W. Panuelo, Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine and Palau's Vice President Raynold B. Oilouch. The U.S. has promised not just one, but two infusions of new aid to the region, totaling $101.5 million, geared toward climate change resilience and sustainable development, among other issues. This week, the U.S. and its allies pledged to develop a deep-sea port in the Solomon Islands.
Australia and New Zealand remain the dominant financiers of Pacific aid, delivering some 54% of the more than $2 billion (USD) in assistance given to Pacific island nations between 2011 and 2017, Pryke says. Japan, China and the U.S. round out the list of top five donors, with the U.S. giving a little more than 7% over the same time period.
Starting in 2006, China's engagement in the Pacific region ""really started ramping up, reflecting similar trends elsewhere in the world,"" Pryke says. Between 2011 and 2017, Beijing gave about 8% of all foreign aid to the Pacific region with more than 80% of it through concessional loans. These loans, with their long-term payment plans, have led some experts to accuse China of ""debt-trap diplomacy.""
China is winning government contracts and dominating the infrastructure space in the region, Pryke says, and the way Chinese state-owned enterprises interact with island nations should be more of a concern than the possibility of China setting up a military base.
Chinese state-owned enterprises were pushing hardest for the Solomon Islands to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan, says Tarcisius Kabutaulaka, a political scientist from the Solomon Islands at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
""These companies that have operations around the world and, to a large extent, it's in their interest to see that there is diplomatic relations,"" he says. ""And so their bottom line is about making profit, just like companies anywhere in the world.""
Meanwhile, there has also been an influx of Chinese immigrants to build these projects because Chinese firms prefer to use Chinese labor — causing tensions over jobs and business practices across the Pacific region.
""So the landscape is dramatically changing,"" Pryke says. ""And it's only in the last few years that we've seen the tipping point, where the rest of the world started paying attention, because you can't avoid the footprint of China on the Pacific now — it's just everywhere.""

** How Virtual Reality Can Help People Better Understand Climate ... **

* https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780373013/how-virtual-reality-can-help-people-better-understand-climate-change *



      Nathan Rott
    

As communities plan for sea level rise, it can be hard to convince residents of the dramatic changes in store. A California scientist is testing one possible answer: virtual reality.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
How do you show people and convince them of a future that has never been? That's one of the biggest challenges facing climate scientists and communities trying to convey the magnitude of the coming environmental change. NPR's Nathan Rott has the story of a climate scientist who is using technology to try and drive it home.
NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Near the back wall of a crowded southeast Baltimore auditorium, Monica Wimberly (ph) settles into a metal chair and slips a bulky gray headset over her eyes.
JULIANO CALIL: Is it too tight?
MONICA WIMBERLY: Oh, no, it's just right.
CALIL: Can you see a screen in front of you?
WIMBERLY: Yeah.
ROTT: It's a virtual reality headset, the kind that you usually see at Best Buy, not a community meeting. And the man you hear helping her is Juliano Calil.
WIMBERLY: Click anywhere on the screen to continue.
CALIL: Yeah.
ROTT: Calil is a climate researcher and teaches at Middlebury Institute of International Studies. He's also the guy who helped create the virtual reality program that Wimberly is about to experience.
CALIL: If you feel a little dizzy, just close your eyes and take it off and then I'll come help you, OK?
WIMBERLY: Virtual Planet sea level - OK, this is nice.
ROTT: Wimberly is getting an immersive Google Earth-like view of a park in her neighborhood as it looks today. It's a low-lying industrial area close to the port. There's a shoreline, baseball diamonds, a senior center. Her view is like a bird's hovering just off the coast looking inland. But this program also shows a future.
WIMBERLY: Then it tells me to slide this over. And then it says I can go six feet.
ROTT: A future with rising seas.
WIMBERLY: Ooh, it got dark. Oh, my God. The water's right there, the bridge - oh, gee.
ROTT: Wimberly is now seeing what could happen here as sea levels rise. Here's Connie Monroe (ph) Hue Galloway Sr. (ph) and Michelle Gregory (ph) seeing the same.
CONNIE MONROE: Oh, oh, the water's coming up.
HUE GALLOWAY SR: Oh, shoot. That's going to take out a lot.
MICHELLE GREGORY: Wow. Yeah. That's a lot of water.
ROTT: The ballparks are underwater. The senior center is partly underwater.
MONROE: Our house is underwater. You know what? It's sort of scary the fact that the water could come up that high.
ROTT: Climate change and its impacts are scary. Sea levels could rise two to four feet in Maryland by the end of the century. Under a worst-case scenario, researchers at the University of Maryland say it could also go far higher. But for many people living near the coast, sea level rise is not top of mind. Outside of the community center, Jackie Specht, the coastal science program manager at The Nature Conservancy, says that's partly because it's just so hard for most folks to fathom.
JACKIE SPECHT: If it's hard to imagine, it's hard to kind of face and prioritize it, especially when there are so many tangible issues that they're facing on the day to day.
ROTT: That is why The Nature Conservancy partnered with Calil, the climate scientist we met earlier, to make the virtual reality program that people are using inside - to bring a sense of immediacy and realness to the conversation, not just in Baltimore but also thousands of miles away on the gold sand beaches of Long Beach, Calif.
CALIL: One thing you can help is with spotting the drone so...
ROTT: Calil has agreements in place to make three of these virtual reality program so far - the one in Baltimore, here in Long Beach and another in his current hometown, Santa Cruz - all coastal cities that are already facing the impacts of rising seas. After launching his drone, Calil explains that those impacts will be different in every different place. After getting these photos, Calil will use local elevation data, flood information and sea level rise projections to make site-specific renderings for what each place should expect to see with rising seas.
CALIL: The idea is to help the city to have a tool to show folks what some of the projected impacts are but also what some of the solutions could look like.
ROTT: In the future versions of these programs, Calil is hoping to make solutions part of the experience. So a person wearing the headset can not only push a button and watch sea levels rise, but they could also click another to see how their city is planning to adapt to that change.
CALIL: Maybe we want to build a sea wall. So what would that look like? And then we can project - show the sea wall and look at the impacts to the beach. You have a sea wall, but over time, you may lose the beach.
ROTT: By illustrating those trade-offs, by giving people a way to see those changes, Calil hopes to make people better informed and more engaged as towns around the country begin planning for an uncertain future.
(CROSSTALK)
ROTT: Back in southeast Baltimore, Sharon Oliver (ph) has spent a few minutes with the virtual reality program when she starts to shake.
SHARON OLIVER: Oh, my gracious. I am not ready for this. How do I get out of here? I'm not ready for this.
CALIL: Just close your eyes. Close your eyes and take it off.
ROTT: Oliver has a phobia of water. She's lived through flooding here caused by rain. After she takes a beat, Isaac Hametz, a research architect who's working on a proposed climate adaptation project here, brings her to a table with a topographical 3D map of the area and what they plan to do.
ISAAC HAMETZ: OK. So you just saw the sea level rise.
OLIVER: Right.
HAMETZ: OK. Good. You got that. So this is kind of what we're - the proposed design is to help prevent some of the flooding that you saw...
OLIVER: OK. So what would this be?
ROTT: Oliver spends about 10 minutes at the table grilling Hametz with questions about how they aim to prevent the flooding - with what materials, who's going to pay for it and on and on and on. Hametz is more than happy to answer every one. Nathan Rott, NPR News.

A vineyard worker drives a grape harvester tractor in the Bordeaux region of southwestern France, where climate change is raising new challenges for winemakers.
In France, climate change is already affecting one of the country's most emblematic industries — winemaking. French vintners say heat, drought and erratic weather are altering the landscape and their centuries-old way of working.
Brothers Remi and Gregoire Couppé are fourth-generation winemakers who craft a top vintage, grand cru St. Emilion. In the past few years they've been confronted with some new challenges. Remi Couppé, 44, says there's no denying the weather is getting hotter and drier.
""Because of the grapes. They show us the change,"" he says. ""Especially in alcohol. The alcohol level has been getting higher in the last five years."" These days, the alcohol content by volume can reach 15%, he says; when he was a boy, ""it was maximum 12 [% ABV]. It's causing me some problems when I start the vinification process, because I have to use new yeast to avoid too much alcohol. It's really new for me.""
The higher alcohol levels come from increased sugar in the grapes because of more sun and heat. What's also new are some of the plants sprouting up between the vines. Couppé picks a flowery-looking weed, holding it up to the blazing sun. ""This plant is from the south of Europe and I never saw it here in my life before four years ago.""
Couppé says they have to be careful when using the mechanized harvester now, because such plants can get mixed in and add a taste to the grapes.
The brothers say that in the past three years they've stopped a process called ""stripping,"" where most of the vine leaves are removed just before the harvest. Now they need the leaves' shade to keep the grapes from burning on the vine. Couppé points to a shriveled, sun-exposed cluster of grapes next to the dark, plump ones still shaded by the leaves.
Harvest time is also arriving earlier across all French winemaking regions. At Chateau Smith Lafitte in the Graves wine area of Bordeaux, dozens of pickers head into the rows of vines with their buckets and baskets. Vinemaster Nicolas Poumeyrau says it's not just the heat and drought that are causing problems.
""It's the more drastic episodes of weather conditions,"" he says. ""So when it rains, it rains a lot. When it's cold, it's colder maybe a little bit longer, especially in the beginning of spring. So more severe conditions than before.""

                Brothers Gregoire (left) and Remi Couppé are fourth-generation winemakers. Remi Couppé says hotter and drier weather has changed the way they have to harvest grapes.

Brothers Gregoire (left) and Remi Couppé are fourth-generation winemakers. Remi Couppé says hotter and drier weather has changed the way they have to harvest grapes.
In the past couple of years, Poumeyrau says, some chateaux have been banding together to fight the increasing frequency of hailstones. They're now hooked up to radar systems that let them know when a hailstone-charged cloud is approaching.
""So we launch some helium balloons together, and on those balloons we attach hydroscopic salt,"" he says. ""The balloon is sucked into the storm cloud and the hydroscopic salt burns, transforming the hail into rain.""
The French government is now looking for ways to help winemakers adapt to the new conditions.
Nathalie Ollat heads the Institute of Science for Vine and Wines, in the city of Bordeaux. Scientists here are studying the changing climate's effects on grapes, both in the laboratory and in a 25-acre vineyard.
""So here we are in a vineyard in the middle of the city,"" she says with a laugh.
Ollat says they're experimenting with dozens of varieties of more heat-tolerant grapes from southern and eastern Europe — places like Spain, Portugal and Georgia — comparing their performance to the traditional grape varieties of Bordeaux, particularly merlot and cabernet sauvignon. Scientists in white lab coats can be spotted between the leafy green vines, picking the grapes so they can examine their flesh, seeds and skin.
""We have to study them in detail and see how they perform in terms of yield, but also in terms of fruit quality and fruit composition,"" says Ollat. ""We want to see their potential to be introduced in Bordeaux and to blend with the other Bordeaux varieties, while keeping the style.""
Bordeaux wines are an assemblage, or blend, of grape varieties and are named after the chateau where they're grown, harvested and blended together. The problem with introducing new varieties is that under rules set out by the French wine-governing body, INAO, an authentic Bordeaux wine can be made from just six authorized grapes, even though experts predict some of those varieties may not be able to survive as the climate heats up.
American Mark Gowdy used to work with the California water board. He's now Ollat's colleague at the Institute of Science for Vine and Wines, where he's studying the effect of drought on vines. He says they've selected six varieties of grapes from other parts of Europe to study very closely; they want to see how the fruits respond to temperature, soil and water content as it gets hotter and dryer.
""Evidence shows they behave differently,"" says Gowdy. ""Some varieties will slow down and use water more efficiently in response to increasing temperature. So in the future, as the climate changes, this could help growers select vines that can better adapt to their circumstances.""

                Nathalie Ollat, who heads the Institute of Science for Vine and Wines, says researchers are experimenting with dozens of varieties of more heat-tolerant grapes from southern and eastern Europe.

Nathalie Ollat, who heads the Institute of Science for Vine and Wines, says researchers are experimenting with dozens of varieties of more heat-tolerant grapes from southern and eastern Europe.
Gowdy is also examining the ugni blanc grape, which is used to produce cognac. That region lies just above Bordeaux, along the Atlantic coast of France, and producers there are also concerned about climate change. Vineyards are becoming more water stressed in many parts of the world, says Gowdy, but it can be particularly difficult in France and Europe, where strict authenticity standards generally do not allow winemakers to irrigate.
Winemaker Alain Maufras stands among the oak barrels in the cellar of his Chateau Pontac Monplaisir, grousing with his vine master about what they call the rigid, antiquated system governing French wine. Maufras says he applied for permission to irrigate this summer but was turned down. He had some 300-year-old vines die in the successive heatwaves. ""That wouldn't have happened if I had been able to practice drip irrigation, like they do in California,"" he says.
Maufras says in today's context, the lack of pragmatism makes no sense.
""Bordeaux is no longer the center of the wine world. People are making wine everywhere and they're evolving a lot faster than we are. We are living in a bubble.""
Bordeaux winemakers such as Maufras say that if they're going to adapt and survive — either with the grapes they have, or by planting new varieties — the centuries-old rules governing Bordeaux wines will have to evolve as well.
But agronomic scientist Ollat says irrigation is not a sustainable option. ""In the future, if there's a lack of water, it will be kept for crop production — to feed people — and not for wine,"" she says. ""The grapevine comes from the Mediterranean region and it has a great ability to adapt to drought.""
In a sign of how serious the situation has become, this past July the French wine governing body, the INAO (Institute National de l'Origine et de la Qualité), approved the use of seven new grapes for certain categories of Bordeaux wines.

Children play around trees downed by Cyclone Idai at the Guara Guara resettlement site in Mozambique, where thousands of people are still living more than nine months after the storm.
In early March, people who live along Mozambique's long coastline began to hear rumors about a cyclone.
The storm was forming in the Indian Ocean, in the narrow band of warm water between Mozambique and the island of Madagascar. Overnight on March 14, 2019, the storm struck Mozambique head-on, barreling over the port city of Beira and flooding an enormous swath of land as it moved inland toward Zimbabwe.
In low-lying, rural Buzi district, the wind arrived like an explosion. It tore the roofs off homes and schools and churches. It ripped trees out by their roots. When the floodwaters came the next day, there were perilously few high spots left where people could escape.

                Cyclone Idai destroyed much of Buzi district in Mozambique. The storm is one of multiple major disasters that affected the country in 2019.

Those in some of the worst-hit areas were cut off for weeks. Neighbors rescued each other and did their best to help each other survive. At least 600 people died in Cyclone Idai, according to the United Nations.
Mozambique's long coastline, sprawling river delta and changing weather patterns make it susceptible to multiple hazards as the climate changes. Flooding, heat waves, cyclones and drought are all getting more frequent and severe as the Earth gets hotter.
Five weeks later, a second cyclone — this one dubbed Kenneth — hit a less populated area on the border between Mozambique and Tanzania. It was the strongest cyclone to ever make landfall in Africa.
In all, the back-to-back storms seriously affected about 2 million people.

                Siblings Luis Chopace and Mariamo Chopace at the grave of their sister Sumbo Chopace, who was killed when her home collapsed during Cyclone Idai. Mozambique's government is struggling to make the country more resilient in response to extreme weather.

""The example of Mozambique must be an alert for all,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said when he visited Beira over the summer.
The disasters put Mozambique's government and citizens in the unenviable position of responding to an onslaught of climate-driven disasters while also doing their best to prepare for an even more dangerous future. They also have made clear that, absent international climate action, there's only so much that vulnerable countries can do to adapt to extreme weather.
The Front Lines
Long before the cyclones of 2019, Mozambique's government and the International Red Cross had realized that flooding was a serious problem in the country. In 2000 and again in 2013, rivers overflowed and hundreds were displaced by water.
But far fewer people died as a result of the 2013 floods. In the intervening years, Mozambique's government and the International Red Cross had studied where and how people were vulnerable to floods and other disasters, then asked community leaders to volunteer to serve on Disaster Risk Reduction Committees for their towns and neighborhoods.

                Antonio Cossa is a member of the Disaster Risk Reduction Committee in the town of Xidwaxine. The committee has helped residents become more resilient when faced with droughts and floods.

Such a decentralized approach to disaster preparedness is something that the Red Cross and others argue for around the world. The idea is that local leaders learn how to prepare for disasters and help their neighbors stay safe during extreme weather events.
Such programs are not a replacement for national and international climate action, but they are nonetheless an important part of building climate resilience in many places.
By 2017, more than 14,000 people were serving on more than 1,000 local committees around Mozambique, according to the World Bank.
""I'm responsible for making sure everyone knows where the high ground is,"" explains Luis Josine, who has lived in the farming community of Mondiane since 1961 and became the leader of his local disaster committee when it was founded five years ago.
The tools and training he received were relatively basic: a handheld radio for weather warnings, an orange vest, a whistle and three flags of different colors.
Mondiane is near a river that's prone to flooding. In 2000, dozens of people who lived in this area drowned, Josine says.
Today when there is a flood warning, Josine goes through town blowing a whistle and waving a flag. If the flag is blue, it means a flood is likely in two or three days, he explains. If it's yellow, it means one day. If the flag is red, it's an emergency, and people should evacuate immediately.
""It is good,"" he says. ""People listen. They know to leave and go up the road."" That makes him feel proud, especially since he has noticed that the flood risk in the town of Mondiane is increasing.
""We've been noticing the climate changing here since around the year 2000,"" he explains. ""The floods are getting bigger and more severe. The droughts are getting longer.""
Climate scientists say that's in keeping with trends in the whole region and that extreme weather is expected to get more common as the Earth continues to heat up.
'We Are Really Suffering'
More extreme weather can also lead to less resilience.
""Disasters put people back into poverty,"" says Michel Matera, a senior analyst at the World Bank in the capital of Mozambique, Maputo. Without efforts to decrease the damage from floods and other disasters, he says, people will be ""continuously trapped into poverty.""
It's particularly challenging to avoid that vicious cycle when climate change drives more than one disaster in a short period of time
In the months after the cyclones drew international attention to Mozambique, another disaster was unfolding more quietly: a drought.

                Farmers in the town of Mondiane meet to discuss sustainable farming practices in November. Members of the local disaster preparedness committee wear orange vests with the acronym for the national disaster preparedness agency.

The rain from the cyclones had come all at once, in a torrent, but the more moderate, continuous rain that farmers rely on didn't fall in much of the country. Disaster Risk Reduction Committees worked to lessen the drought's blow.
""We collect the water, we do our farming very carefully,"" explains Juliet Fernando Chaque, a member of the local committee in the town of Xidwaxine.
She says the community has done a lot in recent years to cope with extreme weather, including drought. For example, the town now has a communal silo to store food, and farmers plant crops that are tolerant of drought, like sweet potatoes.

                Juliet Chaque is a member of the Disaster Risk Reduction Committee in the town of Xidwaxine. She says the current drought has overwhelmed residents.
                
                
                    
                    NicholeSobecki/VII for NPR
                    
                
hide caption

But this ongoing drought has been so extreme, it has overwhelmed their efforts. It began in 2018, and at this point, any food that residents managed to store is long gone. The soil is dry and cracked. Planting season came in September and still there was no rain. So there's almost no planting.
Women from Xidwaxine have started walking three hours to a lake where water lilies grow to harvest the plants and eat the bitter tubers at the base of the roots.
""We are really suffering,"" Chaque says.
Adapting to drought here will likely require comparatively big, expensive infrastructure projects to bring water out to the fields. Putting the brakes on climate change in general will require a global shift away from fossil fuels that has been slow at best.
That's a difficult reality for local leaders like Chaque, who have proudly, persistently pushed their communities to become more resilient to global changes that they cannot control.

** The Decade, Past And Future, In Climate Change : NPR **

* https://www.npr.org/2019/12/22/790631821/the-decade-past-and-future-in-climate-change *

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with climate scientist Brenda Ekwurzel about how the climate has changed over the last decade and what that means for the next one.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
We're approaching the end of a decade during which the effects of climate change have become more and more noticeable, so we're going to begin today with a closer look at what the past 10 years have meant for our climate and a look ahead at where we're likely to be climate-wise a decade from now.
For that, we've called on Brenda Ekwurzel. She is the director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists. She says that she and her colleagues see reasons for both pessimism and optimism.
BRENDA EKWURZEL: What struck us all was that this decade was marked both by disasters unfortunately made worse by climate change and a surge in clean power deployment.
MARTIN: We're going to hear more about some of the biggest storms of the past decade in a couple of minutes. But first, we asked Brenda Ekwurzel to tell us what climate trends she'll be looking for over the next 10 years.
EKWURZEL: Between now and 2030, we're going to continue to warm because we've baked in the amount of warming because of past emissions. And that point at 2030, we're going to start seeing what our past emissions and the choices we make over this decade regarding emissions of carbon into the atmosphere will really determine which pathway we go on beyond 2030.
MARTIN: Ekwurzel says the key will be whether countries around the globe, including the U.S., can build on existing climate agreements.
EKWURZEL: In general, there was a huge surge forward this decade because the world leaders came together in Paris in 2015 and created the Paris climate agreement, where all countries are saying, we're going to put our chips on the table and see how deep we can reduce our own emissions. And the U.S. was in that agreement, part of that 2015 Paris agreement. And the U.S. has signaled pulling back from that on the national scale and international scale.
At the same time, what gives me optimism is that leaders around the world, children like Greta Thunberg leading Fridays For Future strikes every Friday and getting the attention of world leaders. And in the U.S., cities and states and people in communities are saying, we are still in Paris. And so, in fact, we are growing the U.S. economy, but at a less carbon-intensive economy.
MARTIN: Well, you mentioned earlier that there's also been an unprecedented deployment of clean power technology. Can you tell us a little bit more about that?
EKWURZEL: One of the things that also happened over this decade is the price of some clean, renewable energy to power our electric sector has come down. For example, solar panels, the costs now are at least 80% cheaper. The price of wind and solar is lower than the price of a coal-fired power plant per kilowatt hour. So when you're getting a price point where something is much cheaper to make, but it's also cleaner and better for the environment, that's super exciting, that innovation.
And that means that can drive the electrification of end uses. And there, we're having innovation, too, because you have electric cars. You have solar panels on people's roofs or in buildings. And they're also having onsite storage so that you can have 24/7 power. And that's some very exciting innovation that's also happened in the clean energy space this decade.
MARTIN: Is that mainly by individual consumers? Is this taking place on a broad enough scale to make a difference?
EKWURZEL: The deployment of clean energy options is happening across the world globally, and in some places more than others. So businesses are really starting to embrace cleaner energy because it makes economic sense and individuals are also demanding that as well.
Unfortunately, right now, the holy grail is to try to have clean energy that is cheaper so that everyone can have energy independence and be - climbing out of energy poverty is what we call it. And so that's something that is - really, we have to push the science, and we have to push the research and development to make sure everyone can have access to clean energy at a reasonable cost.
MARTIN: That was Brenda Ekwurzel, a senior climate scientist and the director of Climate Science at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Brenda Ekwurzel, thank you so much for talking with us, and happy holidays to you.
EKWURZEL: Thank you. Happy holidays.

NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Ashley Whillans, behavioral scientist at Harvard Business School, about why many people care deeply about climate change, but slow to adopt climate-friendly behaviors.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: 
Climate change is in the news constantly and at the top of a lot of people's minds. But when it comes to changing our daily habits to include more climate-friendly behaviors, we don't always succeed. Our co-host Ailsa Chang has been exploring why.
AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: Let's be honest now. In the rush of your day, do you ever find yourself tossing a plastic water bottle into the trash rather than taking the extra 30 seconds it would take to walk it to a recycling bin? And do you do that in spite of the fact that you think of yourself as environmentally conscious? Well, Ashley Whillans, a behavioral scientist at Harvard Business School, says you are not alone.
ASHLEY WHILLANS: That's exactly what we find in our data, is that when people are feeling pressed for time, environmental actions that don't take very much time all of a sudden feel impossible - composting, recycling, remembering to turn off all the lights in your house before you leave.
CHANG: And there's actually a term for this. It's called the intention-action gap, which means you can care deeply about the environment and still fail to do things you know are good for the environment. So Ashley Whillans is trying to bridge that gap. She wants to help people make decisions that benefit their own health, their happiness and also benefit the planet. Her target now - people who drive alone to work every. Turns out, though, commuting is not an easy behavior to change.
WHILLANS: So we worked with employees at a large airport - nearly 80,000 employees. We ran these experiments in this organization because employees told us they wanted to take transit. They wanted to carpool with their colleagues.
We tried every trick in our tool kit as behavioral scientists. We told employees that lots of other people were commuting in these actives in sustainable ways. We made carpooling really easy by matching people with other employees who lived really close to them. We even offered free transit passes. Who doesn't like free stuff?
CHANG: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah.
WHILLANS: And what we found is none of these interventions had any meaningful impact.
CHANG: Wow.
WHILLANS: But all hope is not lost in the world. We think we have some reason to believe that the organization was making driving alone simply too easy. Parking was free.
CHANG: So what do you think it would take to get people to actually change their commuting behavior?
WHILLANS: We're trying a lot of different incentives now. And financial incentives seem to help push people in favor of taking these more alternative forms of commuting. And taking parking away, although obviously, that would cause some pushback from employees, does seem to be effective. When people have no other option, they're open to alternatives and can enjoy them.
CHANG: Are you saying that the stick works a lot better than the carrot often?
WHILLANS: I think in the context of commuting, which is a habitual, everyday behavior where driving alone is kind of more comfortable and a little bit nicer, that sticks seem to work better than carrots.
CHANG: Well, are there other tactics that come to mind if you want to get people to stop driving alone in their cars?
WHILLANS: Yeah. We're also trying to move away from this social focus of carpooling. Most carpooling apps in organizations are like, hey, carpooling is a way to get to know your fellow colleagues. And really - actually what we're finding is the last thing you want to do at 7:45 in the morning on your way to work is have a colleague talk to you...
CHANG: (Laughter).
WHILLANS: ...Before you have to go and talk...
CHANG: That's so true.
WHILLANS: ...To colleagues all day. So we think that there's been a bit of an issue with marketing.
CHANG: This is all so interesting. It makes me feel like maybe behavioral science is still vastly underused when it comes to tackling something like climate change. I mean, what do you think?
WHILLANS: I think that behavioral science principles, you can start to see them slowly emerging in this conversation around climate change and sustainability. If you get an energy bill, maybe your energy use is being compared to your neighbors. And that's a direct result of behavioral science research.
But I think the gains have been fairly small, even in my own experiment. Behavioral science didn't work because the organization offered free parking. So I think scientists like me are going to need to work together with organizations and with transportation specialists to design cities and structures with behavioral science in mind.
CHANG: Ashley Whillans is an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School.
Thank you very much for joining us.
WHILLANS: Thank you so much for having me.

Homes destroyed by Cyclone Idai litter the riverbanks of Buzi district, Mozambique. Weather forecasters there say they do not have all the resources they need to cope with more extreme weather affecting the country as a result of climate change.
Normal November weather in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, is pleasant and warm with a chance of epic thunderstorms. The sun will be shining in the morning, and then boom the sky opens up and a stiff wind begins to blow and it's probably best if you're inside.
At 10 a.m. on an 85-degree Thursday this November, Mozambique's lead weather forecaster, Acacio Tembe, was stooped at a computer at the National Institute of Meteorology, trying to figure out whether a storm was in the cards that afternoon. He toggled between tabs with global weather maps put out by the U.S. Navy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the European Union, the United Kingdom and Japan. On every map, clouds and bands of rain moved in a lazy loop across Mozambique and neighboring South Africa.

Tembe's phone rang. The man on the other end was in charge of drainage and water resources for the city of Maputo, and he wanted to know: Is there going to be a storm? Because just an inch and a half of rain can cause flooding in city streets.
""We don't know,"" Tembe told him. ""We are still analyzing the information.""
Tembe promised to let him know if they decided to issue a weather warning and then hung up and leaned forward in his swivel office chair. He stared silently at the clouds moving across his screen, as if putting his face closer to the monitor might somehow give him what he really needed: a map with better resolution.

Mozambique is one of many countries around the world where weather forecasting is lagging behind even as climate change drives more extreme and variable weather. In Bangladesh, tropical storm warnings are not adequately reliable. In Peru, the national government is trying to get weather and climate information to residents who are experiencing more extreme weather. The World Meteorological Organization is working on upgrading flash flood warning systems in more than 50 countries around the world, including Mozambique.
Mozambique's meteorologists currently rely heavily on weather data and models collected and created by, and primary tailored to, the needs of other countries.
""Right now, we're using global models,"" Tembe explains. They're helpful for understanding the large-scale weather forecast for the country — for example, figuring out if it's going to rain later in the week or if a cyclone is brewing off the coast.
But Tembe says the information from these models isn't specific enough to consistently predict local and short-term weather. That is an increasingly serious problem, because weather in Mozambique is getting more extreme.
""Nowadays, we have more intense phenomena,"" he explains. ""More cases of strong rains, the heat is stronger, the winds are stronger. It's different from the past."" Mozambique is already suffering longer droughts and more frequent and severe storms than it was earlier this century, because the climate is changing.

                Acacio Tembe, Mozambique's lead forecaster, says the country is experiencing an increase in extreme weather, including more heavy rain, longer droughts and more frequent and severe cyclones and heat waves.

Dangerous fallout
That extreme weather can be deadly. Much of the country is currently suffering from a drought that is straining food supplies. And this spring two powerful cyclones hit Mozambique in quick succession, killing hundreds of people and destroying thousands of buildings. The first, Cyclone Idai, hit near Mozambique's third largest city, Beira, ripping apart homes and flooding much of the city.
Credit: Alyson Hurt/NPR
""The exposure of disaster risk for Mozambique will increase as a consequence of climate change,"" says Antonio Queface, an atmospheric scientist in the physics department of Maputo's Eduardo Mondlane University. ""[If] we look specifically for the tropical cyclones, from 1979 up to recent years, even including Idai in 2019, you can see there's a change in patterns. The cyclones become more severe, with strong winds and rain, and more frequent.""
Everyday weather is also becoming more extreme and harder to predict. As is true in much of the world as the Earth gets hotter, climate change is also making extreme rain more likely. That means that a larger share of the precipitation that falls on the country is forecast to come in big dumps as opposed to more moderate rainstorms.
It all adds up to more and more risk for people across Mozambique. In coastal communities on the country's long Indian Ocean coast, sea level rise and more intense tropical storms are making life both more dangerous and uncertain. For the more than 3 million families that farm in Mozambique, longer dry stretches can mean fewer crops and dead livestock.
In order to adapt, residents need more accurate information, both about the local weather on any given day and about how weather patterns are changing. Both will require better weather and climate forecasting capability.
What's missing

                A satellite dish outside Mozambique's National Meteorology Institute receives weather information from European Union satellites. Meteorologists say they need more weather data for accurate local forecasts.

Queface says there are two missing pieces right now: weather forecasting models with higher resolution, so meteorologists can zoom in and give residents more specific information, and more weather data to make those models accurate.
Over the last two decades, the international weather maps available to Mozambique through the United Nations World Meteorological Organization, the European Union and national governments including the United States have all become more detailed, as weather satellite technology has advanced. But not all of that data is available to forecasters in other countries in real time, in part because many countries do not have the computing power or the Internet speeds necessary to get and use the data for short-turnaround forecasts.
""I think it's a challenging issue on the models,"" Queface says. ""How do you give inputs to the model? What data do you have? Africa as a continent, maybe excluding South Africa, there's a scarcity of meteorological data"" available for local and national weather forecasting.
It's not just satellite data. Mozambique has just a handful of weather stations taking measurements across the country, according to the National Institute of Meteorology.
Without accurate, continuous, local information about wind, humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation and other basic weather measurements, a higher-resolution, Mozambique-specific weather model would still be inaccurate, Queface says. ""[It's] garbage in, garbage out on the model. So the model itself doesn't solve anything.""

Radar enters the picture
In the early 2000s, Mozambique's government partnered with the World Bank to install two weather radar stations. The goal was to collect the kind of data meteorologists need to make accurate forecasts and also to help scientists track changes in the country's climate.
One radar installation was in the coastal city of Beira, and the second was a few hours north of the capital, in the city of Xai-Xai. When the Xai-Xai location opened in 2004, then-President Joaquim Chissano attended the so-called baptizing of the installation and gave it a name: ""Life Radar.""
""It was something that made the people here very proud,"" says Salamao Mausse, the longtime janitor for the local meteorology office in charge of the radar. ""That the radar was providing good, accurate weather information to the whole country.""

                Salamao Mausse stands inside the dome of a radar station that stopped running in 2012. He still cleans it every few days, just in case it's ever repaired.

The radar also changed how local residents thought about weather forecasts, he says. In the past, many people hadn't put a lot of stock in local forecasts because they were often wrong. But in 2008, when the radar had been up and running for a few years, there was a storm in the region. The local meteorologists could see from the radar data that the storm was parked over the neighboring province. They put out a forecast warning people there that flooding was likely for the next two days, so they should make sure their cattle were safe and avoid low-lying places.
Indeed, the storm did exactly as they predicted.
""And everyone was really impressed,"" Mausse remembers and laughs. ""They were, like, 'Are you talking to God with that thing?' ""
But shortly after that, according to the National Institute of Meteorology, the radar started to malfunction. It was difficult to keep calibrated and hard to fix because the company that made it, Gematronik, was in Germany. And local technicians in Mozambique didn't have experience with radar.
The radar in Xai-Xai stopped providing data in 2013. Mausse has continued to walk up the hill every few days to clean and dust the radar control rooms, and cut the grass around the outside, with the hope that it will someday be fixed. Mozambique's second radar installation has also stopped working, Tembe says.
At the 2015 American Meteorological Society meeting, researchers presented a study from neighboring South Africa that found that 16 radar systems made by the same company were ""plagued by technical problems."" The study noted that both Mozambique and Botswana have had similar problems. The authors suggest that older radar systems might be more useful in the region in the long run, since they would be easier to maintain with local parts and expertise. Another option could be decentralized data collected by weather sensors in vehicles and mobile phones.
Queface points out that, no matter where weather data comes from, Mozambique will need faster, more reliable Internet, more advanced computing and more training for its meteorologists.

                Forecasters at Mozambique's National Meteorology Institute say they would need more computing power, faster Internet service and more training to use all the satellite data collected about their region.

In search of money 
Many countries hope funding for such upgrades will come out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which is being discussed by leaders from around the world this week in Madrid. Under the agreement, major industrialized countries that have contributed the most to total global greenhouse gas emissions agreed to pay into a global fund that would help cover the costs of managing and adapting to climate change.
Just last week, the fund gave $10 million to the Philippines for upgrading its weather forecasting in some parts of the country.
But the amount of money available for such upgrades lags far behind the amount of money promised. The United States has contributed about a third of the $3 billion that it pledged in 2014 under the Obama administration.
Queface says outside money is crucial if Mozambique wants to build a better weather forecasting system. ""Countries like ours, they have a lot of priorities,"" he says. ""You need schools, you need health centers, you need so many things. And sometimes, a disaster comes and you need relief operations.""

** Fighting Climate Change Is 'About My Home' For Indigenous Teen ... **

<iframe width=""100%"" height=""124"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://player.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/12/13/helena-gualinga-climate-change-activist""></iframe>
Friday marks the last day of the 25th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP25.
World leaders gathered in Madrid to negotiate carbon emissions and the Paris Agreement. Last year, a U.N. International Panel on Climate Change report warned the global community it only has 12 years to avoid the threat of more severe floods, droughts, extreme heat and poverty.
But instead of collaborating to find solutions, COP25 has been defined by protests and frustration.
On Wednesday, Greta Thunberg, Time's “Person of the Year,” criticized governments for lacking urgency. The 16-year-old activist also put a spotlight on indigenous communities’ fight against climate change.
“Their rights are being violated across the world and they are also among the ones being hit the most and the quickest by the climate and environmental emergency,” she said.
Thunberg called for the environmental movement to include more voices like 17-year-old indigenous activist Helena Gualinga, who grew up in a small community in the Ecuadorian Amazon called Sarayaku.
Gualinga says indigenous children are some of the most important activists because by living in native communities, they are protecting the forests in the Amazon.
“What got me into environmental activism was just living and growing up in the community,” she says. “I think that is activism. That's a sign of resistance.”
Oil companies have posed a threat to Gualinga’s community for as long as she can remember, she says. These companies often do not consult indigenous communities before entering their territories, she says.
That’s what happened to Sarayaku — her home. The Ecuadorian government supported oil companies and together, they entered the indigenous territory along with military, she says.
To protect their forests, she says the community had to stand up against these powers. As the first line of defense, men used to run into the forest to protect the community from the military, she says.
“It's about my home. It’s about my people. It's about my family,” she says. “We have this really close relationship to nature. And we live by nature and we live with nature. And that's something that is very important to us.”
The fight to protect the forests later turned to a legal battle in courtrooms. Gualinga’s community won a court case against the Ecuadorian government in 2012 and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica.
Despite these victories, another oil company has since conceded on her community’s land, she says. She predicts this will lead to legal battles.
Since indigenous people are fighting these climate battles in court and in their forests, she says it’s important to represent their communities in spaces like COP25. But she’s disappointed indigenous people are still being “invisibilized” at such events.
Plus, countries like Ecuador attend climate conferences and make “beautiful speeches,” while indigenous territories are being conceded to oil and mining companies, she says.
This causes mixed feelings about events like the U.N. COP25 and doubts on whether activists are doing enough to succeed in stopping the climate crisis, she says.
“I know that this is what I have to do,” she says, “give a voice to the people that have been silenced and the people that don't have a voice.”

** How Climate Change Is Affecting Australia's Fires : NPR **

* https://www.npr.org/2020/01/04/793572196/how-climate-change-is-affecting-australias-fires *

Australia's Conservative government rejects efforts to tackle climate change. NPR's Leila Fadel speaks with former fire commissioner Greg Mullins about the public's anger as parts of Australia burn.
LEILA FADEL, HOST: 
Greg Mullins is the former commissioner for Fire and Rescue for the state of New South Wales. He's joined other emergency leaders demanding the government tackle climate change, which they say is supercharging the fires. We spoke to him just before he headed out to fight the fires. I asked him how the government is handling the crisis.
GREG MULLINS: So our national government - they're missing in action in terms of leadership, and it's all because the penny has dropped with the Australian public that our out-of-control wildfires are driven by climate change. This has been a 20-year trend. We have 10 million acres on fire in one state alone. Our national government doesn't want to know about climate change. They're doing very little to help the states fight these fires.
FADEL: Why is the government - or why has the government been so hostile in pushing for climate change reforms in Australia?
MULLINS: Look; we have a prime minister who was infamous for holding up a lump of coal in Parliament, joking and giggling like a schoolboy, saying, look; this won't hurt you, everybody. This is the basis of our economy. And a couple of prime ministers have lost their jobs over climate change. So he's rested (ph) onto his narrative about doing nothing about climate change and we don't really emit much in Australia.
Our emissions have been going up every year under this government, not down. And as fire chiefs, we've been watching the wildfire situation, our cyclones, our hurricanes, our storms, our floods get worse and worse as extreme weather just gets more and more extreme. So we have areas burning in Australia that have never burned before. We have trees in Tasmania - Huon pine, so they're 3,000 years old. They have no fire scars on them. We have tropical rainforests burning.
FADEL: You know, the people of Australia, in the end, elected this conservative government. They rejected politicians pushing for climate change reforms. Has anything shifted?
MULLINS: There's a lot of debate in Australia, but the public is screaming for action now. It just seems to me that our prime minister does not have his finger on the pulse of the nation because they're seeing things they've never seen before. They're frightened. People in Sydney are all coughing because we're covered in smoke. Australian cities are just - you can't see for more than 200 yards. It's just horrific. And we've lost about 1,500 homes in New South Wales alone. So people are waking up, but it seems our government and our prime minister are not.
FADEL: So let's say Australia does turn a corner. In the end, it's a continent with a tiny carbon footprint, a country of some 26 million people. So if China, India and the U.S. aren't going to reduce emissions, what difference does it make if Australia changes?
MULLINS: So that's been an argument that the prime minister has used. Now, to put it into perspective, out of 200 countries, we're No. 15. So we're not small in the scheme of things. If you add in the coal that we export - we're one of the biggest exporters of coal, oil and gas - we're No. 5.
Look; Australia has always punched above its weight internationally. And what I mean by that is we've taken on issues like apartheid in South Africa, nuclear disarmament. We've taken a moral stance. As a nation, we've always tried to do the right thing. And I think a lot of Australians are looking at our government at the moment and thinking, where is the moral leadership? How can our prime minister go to President Trump or to other countries and say, look; our country is burning; we're doing our bit; you now need to do your bit? We can't do that at the moment because we don't have the moral or ethical standing to be able to make those phone calls.
FADEL: Now, you yourself are a firefighter, and you're headed for the fires. Do you have a sense of when they might be under control?
MULLINS: No, I don't. And, look; most wildfire firefighting in Australia is done by volunteers. And the urban fire departments also send strike teams - so five engines - out to assist. And then we have forestry and national parks. That's a united force.
I was 39 years as a professional firefighter and ended up chief for 13 (ph) years. I've gone back to my roots where I started with my father as a volunteer wildland firefighter. So I've been fighting fires for 47 years. I've never seen anything like this. We saw it coming. All the 29 other ex-chiefs and I have seen this coming for the last 20 years - the bad seasons becoming more frequent.
Around the world, everything's heating up. We're getting wildfires in countries that never had them before, like the U.K., Greenland. This is a worldwide problem. This is climate change in action, and everybody needs to sit up and take notice.
FADEL: That was Greg Mullins, former commissioner for Fire and Rescue for the Australian state of New South Wales.

      Jason Beaubien
    

In the midst of the devastating wildfire season, Australians are still having a hard time finding common ground on what to do about climate change.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST: 
Australians still have a tough time talking about climate change despite suffering record-breaking temperatures and an unprecedented fire season. Global warming is generally accepted as fact in a country that just experienced its hottest and driest year on record in 2019, but Australia is also the world's largest exporter of coal. Last year in a parliamentary election, one of the biggest issues was what the media termed the climate wars. Australian voters rejected the Labor Party, which was lobbying for the country to move aggressively away from fossil fuels.
NPR's Jason Beaubien reports from Sydney.
JASON BEAUBIEN, BYLINE: Unlike debates on the issue in the U.S., where a lot of people refuse to accept established science, in Australia, the debate is more about the urgency of climate change and how much should be done on it and how quickly. With smoke in the air, the record heat, the ongoing drought, millions and millions of acres of land on fire, there are daily reminders of the reality of the changing planet. But that doesn't mean people agree on what should be done about it.
MARK HOWDEN: If you go back a couple of decades, there was largely bipartisan support in terms of climate action.
BEAUBIEN: That's Mark Howden. He's the director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University in Canberra.
HOWDEN: But for a few different reasons, we've gone into a period of extreme polarization about climate change, quite extraordinary degree of polarization about climate change.
BEAUBIEN: Three years ago, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, back when he was the treasurer, famously brought a softball-sized lump of coal into Parliament and thrust it defiantly in the air.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER SCOTT MORRISON: Mr. Speaker, this is coal. Don't be afraid. Don't be scared.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: The Treasurer knows the rule on props.
MORRISON: It's coal. It was dug up by men and women who work and live in the electorates of those who sit opposite.
BEAUBIEN: Morrison said coal exports is what has made the Australian economy globally competitive. He accused legislators who were pushing for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of stifling Australian jobs, and he also suggested that his opponents suffer from a mental disorder.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MORRISON: Mr. Speaker, those opposite have an ideological, pathological fear of coal. There's no word for coalaphobia (ph) officially, Mr. Speaker, but that's the malady that afflicts those opposite.
BEAUBIEN: Howden, from the Australian National University, says the polarization around climate change has kept the country from moving forward - not just to try to reduce emissions, but to put in place additional coping measures, like beefing up firefighting budgets and bringing in more water-bombing airplanes.
HOWDEN: What's really extraordinary in Australia is even though the politics are actually very toxic and problematic, most Australians want action on climate change.
BEAUBIEN: A poll last year from the Lowy Institute, a think tank in Sydney, found that Australians listed climate change as the biggest threat facing the country in the coming decade, and 90% of them said they wanted the government to take action on the issue.
The town of Conjola Park on the east coast, south of Sydney, was ravaged by the wildfires that flared over New Years. More than 80 houses were destroyed, and two people died in the town. The community hall has been turned into a relief supply station. Tables are piled with clothes, toiletries, food, bottles of water. There's still no power, so a generator is running out front to keep ice and milk cold in a refrigerated shipping container.
Deputy Mayor Patricia White is visiting the community center for the first time since the fire.
PATRICIA WHITE: I live about 30 K's up the road. I got stuck in the fires as well, but I've been itching to come down to this community because they are like family to me.
BEAUBIEN: White's an independent who considers herself right of center. She's frustrated by how difficult it is to get people across the political spectrum to compromise during debates about climate change on the city council.
WHITE: They don't want to accept somebody else's opinion.
BEAUBIEN: She says the city council had a huge fight over whether to convert all municipal buildings to run entirely off solar.
WHITE: So do I say to a ratepayer, I'm not collecting the rubbish for, you know, - I'm only going to collect the rubbish every three weeks because I need to save money because I want to put a solar roof on the toilet. You know, you've got a balancing act, and how do you do it?
BEAUBIEN: She says everyone needs to back off, in her words, an inch or two because nearly everyone in Australia accepts that climate change is a real problem. But it's an abstract and, to some, terrifying problem. And agreeing on exactly what should be done about it right now is proving almost impossible.

** 4 Activist Girls Trying To Save The World From Climate Change : NPR **

* https://www.npr.org/2020/01/19/797298179/you-need-to-act-now-meet-4-girls-working-to-save-the-warming-world *



      Anya Kamenetz
    

A teenage girl, Greta Thunberg, has become the world-famous face of the climate strike movement. But she's far from alone: Thunberg has helped rally and inspire others — especially girls.
NPR talked to four teenage climate activists, all girls, from the U.S. and Australia, alongside their mothers. These teenagers are juggling activism with schoolwork and personal time. And their families are working hard to support them as they grapple with the heavy emotions that come with fighting for the future.
In Castlemaine, Australia, Milou Albrecht, 15, co-founded School Strike for Climate Australia, which organizes student walkouts. As massive bush fires engulf parts of her home country, Albrecht's group has been pressuring the German corporation Siemens to withdraw from an Australian coal mining project.
In New York City, Xiye Bastida, 17, led her school in the city's first big student climate strike last March, and along with traveling and public speaking, she and some of her classmates have continued to strike on Fridays ever since. (""Gym is on Fridays, so I have a very low grade in gym,"" she notes.)
In Louisiana, 16-year-old Jayden Foytlin was one of 21 young people who sued the federal government for violating their rights to a livable planet. The young plaintiffs hailed from communities around the country that have been directly affected by global warming — Foytlin, for example, is from south Louisiana, where her home has been flooded in storms.
The lawsuit, Juliana v. United States, was recently thrown out by a federal appeals court. But Foytlin says she's formed lasting friendships with the other plaintiffs. ""We all share one thing in common — we really care about where we're from, and how we are going to continue to live [here].""
In upstate New York, Scout Pronto Breslin, 16, is focused on wildlife. She lives in Rhinebeck, and is the founder of a group called Hudson Valley Wild. ""I volunteer at a wildlife rehab clinic,"" she says, explaining what motivated her activism.""The birds there often come in with blood poisoning because of illegal toxins from chemical runoff and fertilizer.""
Pronto Breslin advises other teens to find what really interests them about the climate movement. She says it could be composting in their schools, gardening, nature: ""Once you find something that you really love, then that will just give you motivation to keep going with it.""
Girls to the front
It's no coincidence that teenage girls are especially visible right now as climate leaders, says Katharine Wilkinson.
""The youth movement is such a great example of the way in which girls and young women are stepping into the heart of this space, and showing us what it looks like to lead with courage and imagination and incredible moral clarity.""
Wilkinson works with a solutions-focused climate organization called Project Drawdown, and delivered a TED talk on how empowering women and girls can help stop global warming.
""When we think about the nexus of climate and gender, there are three big points of intersection,"" she tells NPR.
""One is that the impacts of climate change hit women and girls first and worst,"" particularly in the developing world and in poor communities.
The second, she says, is that ""gender equality is itself a climate solution,"" with women's education and equity leading to smaller family sizes and, research shows, better land management practices.
And the third is what Wilkinson calls ""transformational leadership that is grounded in intersectional feminism and what we might consider more feminine approaches to leading.""
We all need to save the world. It's not up to girls. As much as we admire and love what they're doing. It also doesn't absolve us of responsibility.
Jennifer Breslin
Scout Pronto Breslin's mother, Jennifer Breslin, used to work on gender equity issues at the United Nations. She agrees with Wilkinson: ""I think it's really amazing how many young women are involved in this.""
On the other hand, she says, ""I don't believe 'Girls are going to save the world.' We all need to save the world. It's not up to girls. As much as we admire and love what they're doing, it also doesn't absolve us of responsibility.""
Raised to care for the Earth
Each of these girls expressed her own, independent commitment to the climate crisis — but it's impossible to ignore the upbringings that sparked their engagement.
""My mom and my dad always taught me what it was to take care of the Earth,"" Xiye Bastida says.
Bastida — who has been described as New York City's Greta Thunberg — is the daughter of Geraldine Patrick Encina, a scholar in residence at the Union Theological Seminary's Center for Earth Ethics, and an environmental activist since her own teenage years in Chile. Bastida's father is a member of the indigenous Otomi Toltec nation in Mexico, which advocates for the protection of their local water and land.
Patrick Encina says the family follows indigenous traditions. ""We will do at least one ceremony, you know, to the waters or to the land frequently, maybe once a week.""
Milou Albrecht is the daughter of Susan Burke, a psychologist who works in climate adaptation and disaster recovery. Burke and her husband raised their three children for years in an eco-friendly, rural, intentional community. Albrecht says she grew up going to environmental protests, and that they were ""heaps of fun.""
Social justice was part of Scout Pronto Breslin's upbringing, too. Aside from her mother's work in areas including sustainable development, her father was an anti-apartheid activist in South Africa, and currently works for the U.N.
And Jayden Foytlin's mother is Cherri Foytlin, a direct action climate activist of Afro-Latina-Indigenous descent who is known for opposing an oil pipeline in south Louisiana.
""Some families, they go to baseball games or ballerina concerts,"" notes Cherri. ""Well, it's always been a family function for us to go to marches or meetings or meet with the community and learn how to organize.""
It's always been a family function for us to go to marches or meetings or meet with the community and learn how to organize.
Cherri Foytlin
All of the teenagers, however, made the point that they had friends in the movement whose parents were less aware, less involved or less supportive than their own.
""I have a few friends whose parents will tell them, 'You can not go to that meeting until you finish your homework,' or, 'You have to stop skipping school on Fridays,' "" says Xiye Bastida. She calls it ""a very fine line because no parent wants their kid to fail school.""
Supporting, but also stepping back
Young climate change activists need support, they and their parents say, especially emotional support. ""The toughest moments have been when Xiye just needs a hug,"" says her mother, Patrick Encina.
Climate change is enormous and tragic. It feels very personal to young people in particular, who are more likely than older generations to say that it impacts them personally. That makes it similar to other youth-led movements, such as Black Lives Matter and the March for Our Lives movement against gun violence.
The toughest moments have been when Xiye just needs a hug.
Geraldine Patrick Encina
At the same time, eco-anxiety, depression and secondary traumatic stress are normal psychological reactions to learning about the reality of human-caused environmental destruction. That's according to psychologist Renee Lertzman, who has been working in this area for decades. She compares the situation of these teenagers to her own upbringing in the nuclear age.
""Anyone who's my age knows what it's like to grow up with the threat of nuclear war around you all the time, and how terrifying that is,"" she says. ""So I have a lot of empathy and compassion for what it's like to be a young person in the context of an existential threat. I feel concern, and I feel like we need to be thoughtful about how we navigate this."" 
She says young people need to hear, ""It's not all on them.""
On the positive side, Susan Burke, Milou Albrecht's psychologist mother, says getting involved with a cause you care about can be protective for mental health. ""It's great to take action on things that are worrying you because action is one of the best antidotes to despair and helplessness and hopelessness.""
But Burke cautions that this work must be child-led — you can't push your children to get involved.
It's great to take action on things that are worrying you because action is one of the best antidotes to despair and helplessness and hopelessness.
Susan Burke
Albrecht says her parents are good at listening and supporting, ""but also kind of stepping back and let me do my thing.""
Scout Pronto Breslin's mom, Jennifer Breslin, agrees with that approach. ""We need to not micromanage them. It's really hard. You kind of want to jump in and say, 'Why don't you try this?' ""
Many youth and student groups have created guidelines for adult allies on how to be supportive without taking over.
Balancing school, life and activism
Many activists are also high-achieving students with multiple AP classes and packed schedules. Bastida says to make room for the school strike planning and the traveling and speaking she's doing, she's dropped gymnastics and Model United Nations. No regrets, she says: ""Model U.N. is so stressful. I am more nervous about Model U.N. than [lobbying] the actual U.N. Kids are crazy competitive. I'm not trying to be part of that.""
Nevertheless, they all say that they have to — and their parents encourage them to — make room for downtime and hobbies.
Foytlin likes to draw and play with her little brother. Bastida likes Netflix and taking baths, and she says, ""My dad tells me every day, 'You cannot fix the world if you do not fix up your room.' ""
Pronto Breslin likes taking walks in the woods with her golden retriever, Tess; playing the guitar and listening to Elvis and the Beatles. And Albrecht likes gardening.
Each of these girls says it's important to find joy in the moment, and in the friendships they are making as they work for a better future.
""We advocate [so much] for urgency,"" Bastida says. ""We are saying you need to act now. You need to do this fast. But you cannot live your life in that way. And I think that's the trickiest part — how do you live in a state of urgency without feeling that within you? So we have to remain centered not only in our families, but our communities, in organizing. When we organize, we model the world we want to see.""

** Climate Change Threatens Future Of Sports : NPR **

* https://www.npr.org/2020/01/26/799741441/climate-change-threatens-future-of-sports *

NPR's Michel Martin speaks with journalist Dave Zirin about how climate change is impacting sports around the globe, including the poor air quality at the Australian Open.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
Week 1 of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne is almost in the books. There have already been surprises, like Coco Gauff knocking out defending champ Naomi Osaka in the third round. And there have been climate challenges, too - bad air quality because of the wildfires burning across southeastern Australia, intense rainstorms, even a blanket of red dust from a sandstorm. So what does an increasingly warm planet and the unpredictable weather that comes with it mean for tennis and other outdoor Sports? Dave Zirin of The Nation wrote recently about how climate change is affecting sports, and he's with us now in our studios in Washington, D.C., to talk more about it. Dave Zirin, welcome back. Thanks for joining us.
DAVE ZIRIN: Oh, great to be here.
MARTIN: So in your piece, you describe the extreme weather conditions that we've seen at the Open as the tip of an iceberg - of a melting iceberg, in fact. What did you mean by that?
ZIRIN: Well, I meant that this is an issue that sports needs to reckon with, and so far, it has not reckoned with it whatsoever. This is a very evocative example because it's a Grand Slam event, and people are talking about it. But this has been happening for years in sports on a host of smaller and other fronts like less days to play hockey in Canada because the rinks aren't solid ice. I mean, there are melting rinks in Canada.
Other instances like cardiovascular sports, intense cardiovascular sports like cycling and like marathoning have been cut short because of heat. Outdoor skiing is something that has had to deal with the idea of having to store snow on heavy snow days because they can't be guaranteed snow throughout the year. And that in and of itself leaves a tremendous carbon footprint. So on a host of different fronts, we're in a situation where climate change and sports are colliding.
MARTIN: You know, sometimes the international sports entities have dealt with health challenges like the Zika virus during the Summer Olympics in Brazil. I mean, there was open discussion about that. But you've said that the sports world has really avoided having a conversation about climate change. Why do you think that is?
ZIRIN: Well, because it puts the question of whether or not we should even be playing these sports right now under the microscope like in the context of a warming planet. Are there some sports that we should possibly do away with? I mean, when we're in a situation where it's possible that as many as half of all golf courses could be threatened by rising waters by the end of this century, it raises the question about, should we be building more golf courses, which we are doing?
MARTIN: Is that true? Is that true, by the way?
ZIRIN: Yeah, according to - Golf Digest reported on this, that out of 2,090 - out of 1,000 - roughly out of 1,200 outdoor courses that they looked at, half of them are going to be affected by rising waters.
MARTIN: So are sports organisations like FIFA in soccer or the NFL, the National Football League, or the International Olympic Committee, are they built for talking about big issues like this?
ZIRIN: That's a great question. They're definitely built for starting conversations, which is what we need to do. I mean, these aren't environmental emergency organizations that can step up and do the kind of work that we need to help a warming planet. But they are organizations that can start discussions, and these discussions are certainly desperately needed at this point. You're going to see it this summer in Tokyo at the 2020 Olympics, where they're expecting rising heat, and at the next World Cup, which is going to be held in Qatar, where it's going to be extremely hot. And that's why they moved it to the fall instead of doing it over the summer, as they traditionally do, precisely because of the rising heat.
And so in these contexts, there can be discussions that can be had about how sports should operate. How can sports be more green? How can sports not leave such an intense carbon footprint? I think the Australian Open and what's been happening there opens the way up for all these discussions.
MARTIN: And before we let you go, who do you think should take the lead here? I mean, should it be these organizations that are supposed to look out for the interests of the players as well as the integrity of the sport? Do you think it's like the celebrity athletes? This is one of the subjects of your career is athletic activism and how that affects the athletes' lives and careers. I mean, this is something you've written about extensively for many years now. I mean, what do you think?
ZIRIN: I think we're going to need the top athletes in their sports speaking out and speaking out on behalf of all players and treating it like a workplace safety issue. I think if they're able to do that, it provides an opening for speaking about the environmental impact and talking about the impact on the athletes themselves. I do not think we can trust the leagues, the higher-ups in the leagues, which are basically profit machines, from actually trying to say, well, maybe we can't make as much money but also leave less of a global footprint. It's going to take the athletes to step up and make this thing happen.
MARTIN: That's Dave Zirin. He's a sportswriter for The Nation. That's the progressive magazine. He recently wrote about climate change and its impact on sports. Dave Zirin, thank you so much for talking to us.
ZIRIN: Thank you.

 From
Republican lawmakers in Oregon have walked off the job. They're refusing to meet in the state capitol as the Democratic-controlled legislature seeks to take up a climate change bill.
DAVID GREENE, HOST: 
Republican lawmakers in Oregon have walked away from the state Capitol in protest of climate change legislation. This boycott began in the state Senate on Monday. It expanded to the House on Tuesday. Oregon Public Broadcasting's Dirk VanderHart reports.
DIRK VANDERHART, BYLINE: Republicans don't hold much power in the state capital of Salem, but they do have a nuclear option. If they don't show up, Democrats can't muster the two-thirds quorum needed to conduct business. GOP senators walked away twice last year to block legislation they opposed. Now they're back at it. With Democrats on the verge of passing a bill to sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Republicans in both chambers have now fled the Capitol. They say the new regulations would ratchet up costs, harming people in their rural districts. Herman Baertschiger is Oregon's Senate Republican leader.
HERMAN BAERTSCHIGER: Our district says stop this horrible legislation because they realize that this fundamentally changes the way Oregon's economy is going to be.
VANDERHART: Baertschiger and other members of his party say they'll only return if Democrats either kill the climate change bill or put it before voters in November. Democrats have signaled they won't do either. Democratic Governor Kate Brown has accused Republicans of abandoning their constitutional responsibilities.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KATE BROWN: It's extremely disappointing that instead of staying to do the jobs they were elected to do, Senate Republicans have chosen to take a taxpayer-funded vacation.
VANDERHART: With GOP members of the House joining the Senate boycott, activity in the Capitol has ground to a halt. In past standoffs, Democrats sent state police after absent Republicans. That hasn't happened this time around, but Republican leader Baertschiger says some of his members have crossed state lines just to be safe.
BAERTSCHIGER: I do not know where most of them are, to be quite honest. But they're gone.
VANDERHART: As the stalemate continues, major policy and budget bills hang in the balance. Oregon's legislative session must adjourn in less than two weeks. For NPR News, I'm Dirk VanderHart in Salem, Ore.

A protester holds a sign reading ""The Oceans Are Rising But So Are We"" at an Amazon employee walkout in Seattle, as part of the Global Climate Strike on Sept. 20, 2019. At some companies, employees are putting increasing pressure on their bosses to act on climate change.
Jet fuel-guzzling Delta Air Lines and fossil fuel-pumping BP are vowing to go carbon neutral.
Microsoft and Ikea, behemoths of tech and furniture, have pledged  to go further and actively reduce the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The financial giant Blackrock promises to put climate at the heart of its decisions. 
In short, a slew of major corporations are making promises on climate — lofty ones. 
And it's not just a case of a few headline-grabbing outliers.
More companies are disclosing their carbon emissions, and more of those companies have emissions reductions targets, according to the global nonprofit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). 
 Loading... 
Don't see the graphic above? Click here.
Those targets are also more ambitious. Engie Impact, a sustainability company tied to a French energy group, analyzed CDP data and found ""the intensity of the commitments is rising,"" as Engie Impact's Mathias  Lelièvre puts it.  
 Loading... 
Don't see the graphic above? Click here. 
Companies are promising faster action, too. Instead of setting goals 25 years in the future — a distant target that makes accountability difficult — the average time horizon is now just eight years away, Engie Impact found.
And there's been an acceleration in the rate at which companies set ""science-based targets"" — specific, measurable carbon reduction goals that put a company in line with the Paris Agreement, the global climate accord aiming to hold warming at 2 degrees Celsius or lower. Coca-Cola, Nike, Best Buy, Walmart and Hilton Hotels are among the hundreds of companies with such targets.
According to one analysis, the number of Fortune 500 companies with concrete, ambitious carbon targets quadrupled in the past four years, to 23%.  
Growing pressure to act
This increase in activity comes after decades of pressure from environmental advocates — and despite a lack of action from the U.S. government. 
So after all this time, what might be spurring companies to set new or newly ambitious targets? 
For one thing, the effects of climate change are becoming clearer to companies as wildfires, rising sea levels, droughts and other symptoms of the crisis make headlines and affect business operations. ""It's here,"" says Bruno Sarda, the president of CDP North America. ""It's happening now, not tomorrow."" 
At the same time, solar and wind energy have gotten significantly cheaper, making it easier for some companies to commit to shifting away from fossil fuels.
And an increase in pressure — on multiple fronts — plays a key role. 
""Investors are increasingly asking companies about this,"" says Kevin Moss, who runs the center for business sustainability at the World Resources Institute. ""And not just the traditional activist investors who have been doing it for some time, but mainstream investors."" 
Pressure from customers and the general public is mounting, too, as public awareness and concern grows more intense. And while the federal government in the U.S. has backed away from climate targets, cities and states — not to mention governments abroad — are taking action.
There might be some more surprising sources of pressure, too. Children. 
""I hear from business leaders all the time today that, you know, their kids come home and say, 'What are you doing, Dad?' "" says Elizabeth Sturcken, a managing director at the Environmental Defense Fund who works with businesses on sustainability goals. ""This makes a difference."" 
Employees, too, are increasingly influential. Workers at companies such as Amazon are pushing their bosses to change, and some other companies see this as a way to attract and retain talent.
Kyum Kim is the co-founder of the app Blind, where tech workers discuss their workplaces, and he says those workers are increasingly discussing issues like climate change. In a survey, half his users said a company's climate policy affects whether they want to work there. 
""People talk a lot about compensation, of course, and the work culture,"" he says, ""but I think this is a whole new segment."" 
There's another factor, too, according to Lucas Joppa, the chief sustainability officer at Microsoft. 
He says it helps to frame climate action as an accounting problem, based on quantifying exactly how much companies emit and how much they'll need to cut. 
""That really is what I see flip executives' mindsets around, is to just talk about this in terms that they understand ... a climate 'budget,' "" Joppa says. ""At the end of the day, what companies are really good at doing is making decisions based on numbers.""
The limits of voluntary targets
Of course, setting a carbon budget is one thing. Sticking to it is another. Some climate announcements in the past — such as BP's previous rebranding as ""Beyond Petroleum"" — have been more PR push than actual shift in strategy, and advocates agree that follow-through and accountability will be essential if these new ambitious targets are to have an impact. 
And even if companies make good on their promises, some experts say there can be a danger in relying on big corporations to drive the fight against climate change.
Shalanda Baker, a professor at Northeastern University who studies the social justice dimensions of a transition away from fossil fuels, says vulnerable and marginalized communities need to have input in how the world fights climate change — and feel the benefits of a switch to green energy. 
""I'm just not sure if I have the faith, given that ... corporations are very concerned about expenses and profits, that they would really think about something that may add cost, but that may be more just,"" she says.
Baker says corporate action can be powerful but government policy can make sure vulnerable populations are protected. 
She's not the only one who looks at these voluntary commitments and sees a need for regulation. After all, some companies taking action is nowhere near enough to stop climate change. 
Elizabeth Sturcken at the EDF, who has spent two decades urging companies to act, tells companies that in addition to voluntary cuts in emissions, it's critical for business leaders to engage with policymakers and ask for government action. 
Corporations from BP to PepsiCo say they support a price on carbon, one market-based policy for reducing emissions. Sturcken says companies that really want to lead on climate need to put money toward making such policies a reality.

Rising temperatures are forcing some Alaska Native villages to consider relocating to higher ground. Climate change is also complicating an accurate count for the 2020 census more complicated.
MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
Now to Alaska, where some communities are on the frontlines of the impact of climate change. Warming temperatures and thawing permafrost are forcing some Alaska Native villagers to look for firmer ground on which to live. And that's also making it harder to get an accurate population count for the 2020 census in parts of the state. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang has been traveling to some of these remote areas for this report.
HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Once a decade, the U.S. government's largest peacetime mobilization officially begins with a trek to the most northern state in the union.
(SOUNDBITE OF AIRPLANE)
WANG: Census Bureau officials crossed the tundra of southwest Alaska by bush plane last month to reach the fishing village of Toksook Bay, the first community in the country to be counted for the 2020 census.
JESSICA IMOTICHEY: You land on a strip of ice.
WANG: Jessica Imotichey coordinates the bureau's outreach to tribal governments in Alaska.
IMOTICHEY: The airport terminal is essentially - it's not even a building. It just has a bench in there. You know, it blocks to the wind. And then you go up into the actual village, typically by snow machine.
(SOUNDBITE OF SNOW MACHINE)
WANG: After each village is counted, census workers often hop back on a snow machine, or if you're in the lower 48, a snowmobile or sometimes into a dog sled to journey across miles of frozen ground and ice roads to reach the next village. Temperatures in Alaska, though, have been heating up twice as fast as the global average, making counting in some parts of the state more complicated.
ROMY CADIENTE: We've seen landmasses just disappear overnight. And we're talking a big chunk of land, about 20 feet or so.
WANG: Romy Cadiente is the relocation coordinator for a village northeast of Toksook Bay called Newtok. Many residents there have been forced out by erosion and rising waters that seep through floorboards and lead to black mold in homes.
CADIENTE: There are leaning telephone poles all over the village. Structures are beginning to fall from their foundation.
WANG: The 2010 census counted just over 350 people living in Newtok, and the community has used that number to get its share of an estimated more than $1 1/2 trillion a year in federal funding guided by census data. But last fall, a third of Newtok's residents relocated into new homes in Mertarvik, its replacement village that's on higher ground. And this year, the Census Bureau is planning to count the community as two villages with separate population counts. So I asked Romy Cadiente, what does that mean for how much funding the community receives over the next decade?
CADIENTE: That's a very good question and a very scary question. There's got to be a way for communities that experience these kinds of threats to have additional funding in the transitionary period.
ROBERT PITKA: Recent global warming has a lot of effect in coastal areas, rivers. And it's not just one village. It's in all the villages.
WANG: Back in Toksook Bay, tribal administrator Robert Pitka says climate change brings a particular challenge to Alaska Native villages that rely on funding tied to their census numbers.
What are you worried about over the next 10 years?
PITKA: Oh, I'm just worried that there may be lack of funding to fix all kinds of erosion that's occurring in many villages. It's indescribable.
WANG: For Diana Therchik, it was partly foreseeable. Therchik is the operations manager for the Toksook Bay Sub-Regional Clinic, and she's worried about the ice road other villages rely on to get to Toksook Bay's health clinic. In recent winters, it's sometimes been too warm to drive over a nearby river.
DIANA THERCHIK: It hasn't frozen over, and it's made it more difficult to get seen over here. So they rely on planes more.
WANG: Therchik says the rising temperatures remind her of what Yup'ik elders have long predicted. And she wonders if census workers, who often have to use ice roads to get around, may encounter a vastly different Alaska by the next count in 2030.
THERCHIK: The way things are going, maybe they won't have snow. Maybe they will not have winter. That's like so many years from now. And I just don't know.
WANG: Romy Cadiente says in Newtok, many residents are not waiting to see what else climate change brings.
CADIENTE: There are so many people that are scared about the weather, so a lot of people have been seeking shelter with their relatives all over the region. So you're going to see that census number drop a little bit.
WANG: Ten years from now, though, Cadiente wants to see Newtok's community reunited on solid ground in their new village of Mertarvik - population 350 by the 2030 census, he hopes, or maybe even higher. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News.

Winters are warming faster than other seasons across much of the United States. While that may sound like a welcome change for those bundled in scarves and hats, it's causing a cascade of unpredictable impacts in communities across the country.
Share Your Stories With Us
Four of the warmest Januaries have occurred since 2016. So far, this winter has been one of the warmest on record for much of the United States. What changes are you seeing in your backyard this year? Are warmer winters affecting your job, business or recreational activities? If you're a company owner or local official, are you doing anything different to adapt to increasingly warm or erratic winter weather?Tell us your experiences, and feel free to send a photo that shows a changing winter where you are. We'll use some of your comments and photos for a story on our website.
Temperatures continue to steadily rise around the globe, but that trend isn't spread evenly across the map or even the yearly calendar.
""The cold seasons are warming faster than the warm seasons,"" says Deke Arndt, chief of climate monitoring at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information. ""The colder times of day are warming faster than warmer times of day. And the colder places are warming faster than the warmer places.""
In the U.S., that means winters in both Maine and Alaska are around 5 degrees Fahrenheit hotter on average since the early 1900s. One reason: The snowpack, which is a good reflector of sunlight, is melting earlier in the season. With fewer days of snow cover, sunlight is absorbed into the ground and warms the surrounding area.

Still, winter warming can be seen almost everywhere. January 2020 was the Earth's hottest recorded January on average, compared with 141 years of temperature records. The four warmest Januaries have all occurred since 2016.
""Those changes are big,"" Arndt says. ""We're not just watching numbers. We're watching changes in real people's real lives.""
Here are some of those changes happening around the country.
CALIFORNIA
The nation's largest economy and largest agricultural industry is heavily reliant on snow that falls high in the Sierra Nevada, which acts like a giant reservoir. The snowpack lasts through the winter and melts in late spring and early summer, sending a steady supply of water to farms and cities when they need it most.
But with warming temperatures, California's snowpack is shrinking, both because of increased snowmelt and because more precipitation is falling as rain instead of snow. Across the West, snowpack has already shrunk by 15% to 30%.
""That can have profound ramifications, west of the Rockies especially, when the timing of snowmelt is really important to how we operate reservoirs and share water with each other,"" says Arndt, of NOAA.
With runoff flowing earlier in the year, California's reservoirs may not be able to capture enough to supply the state during the long dry summer. For one thing, reservoirs can't be kept completely full during winter because they might be overwhelmed by floodwaters. And when warmer winter storms cause rain to fall on top of California's snowpack, it dramatically increases the risk of devastating floods.
Warmer winters are also affecting the fruits and vegetables that California sends around the country. The state produces the majority of the country's supply of almonds, wine grapes, walnuts, pistachios and peaches. But many of those crops require a certain amount of cold weather, what's known as ""chill hours."" Without that, pollination can be delayed or incomplete, reducing the crop that farmers get at harvest time.
""Now with the weather changing, it's becoming more of a challenge to get those chill hours,"" says Jonathan Battig, a farm manager for pistachios and walnuts in Arbuckle, California.
According to one study, cold temperatures that many orchard crops need could decrease by as much as 60% in California's Central Valley by 2100. Apples, cherries and pears, which require the longest period of cold weather, could be hit the hardest. That has many in the agricultural industry looking for ways to adapt, whether it's breeding more heat-tolerant trees or finding chemicals that can help trees bloom on a predictable schedule, even when the winter weather is anything but.
SOUTHEAST
For decades, the Southeast actually got cooler while the rest of the country warmed. But now it's warming too, and that includes winters, with the length of the freeze-free season increasing in some places by as much as a week and a half.
That's a problem for farmers, who need cold temperatures for their plants to set fruit. The winter of 2016-2017 was too warm for Georgia peaches, for instance, and about 80% of the crop failed.
Blueberries — a bigger crop in the Peach State than peaches are — also struggle.
""When you talk to blueberry producers and peach producers, they're definitely looking at new hybrids that are more welcoming to low chill hours and different kinds of weather patterns,"" says Pam Knox, an agricultural climatologist at the University of Georgia.
An unusually warm January in Atlanta has also been a headache for beekeepers. If it's not cold enough, honeybees fly out of their hives and queens might start laying eggs. As they expend energy, the bees eat more of the honey they stored for the winter. If their calendar gets too out of whack from the blooms they need for nectar, they risk starvation.
And then there are the mosquitoes that can carry vector-borne diseases. Different species have different needs, but in general, cold winter temperatures kill them or slow down their reproduction cycles.
""Warmer winters will result in, usually, earlier emergence of adult mosquitoes, for example, that bite us earlier in the springtime. It means that larger populations will survive throughout the winter,"" says Duke University professor Bill Pan, who studies environmental change and disease.
It's already warm enough in the South for the mosquito species that can carry dengue, chikungunya and Zika. In some parts of Florida, the mosquitoes can be active year-round. According to the latest National Climate Assessment, dengue cases could go up across the Southeast in the summer, and West Nile will likely increase too.
NORTHEAST
In Maine, skiing, snowmobiling and ice fishing are an important part of the winter economy. Greg Sweetser, of the Ski Maine Association, says ski areas are preparing for climate change by expanding into summer businesses, such as mountain biking.
""It's an insurance policy to some degree,"" he says. ""The climate is changing, it's unclear how incremental the change will be, so ski areas are being proactive.""
Ice fishing is already seeing days shaved off its season in southern Maine, because the window for when lakes freeze over is shortening, says Mark Latti of the state's Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. And one of Maine's largest lakes, Sebago, used to freeze over every other year, he says. ""Now it's once every three years or so.""
Warmer winters have also helped fuel the expansion of a pest that affects outdoor enthusiasts throughout the year: ticks.
Deer ticks transmit several diseases, including Lyme, which has grown from a few hundred cases in Maine more than a decade ago to a high last year of more than 2,100. Cases of another tick-borne disease, anaplasmosis, have also surged in the state to more than 680, up from just single cases in the early 2000s.
Deer ticks first appeared in southern Maine in the mid-1980s, but researchers at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute's Lyme and Vector-Borne Disease Laboratory say their range now extends to the northern reaches of the state.
""It's still colder than the southern tier,"" staff scientist Susan Elias says. ""But it has been warming relatively faster. And so that's going to be helpful to ticks.""
Vector ecologist Chuck Lubelczyk says warmer winters also help create a more hospitable climate for other species and the diseases they carry. The lone star tick has already been found in Maine, dropped by migratory birds from the south. Historically, it hasn't been able to survive the winter, but that's changing.
""This tick is slowly moving its way up the Eastern Seaboard,"" Lubelczyk says, and is now established in southeastern Massachusetts. ""If it does arrive and gets established in Maine,"" he says, it will be ""a game-changer, because it is highly aggressive.""
MIDWEST
Despite the occasional polar vortex that can send temperatures plunging well below zero, generally warmer Midwest winters have implications from agriculture to recreation.
""We talk about this all the time,"" says Dennis Todey, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Midwest Climate Hub, in Ames, Iowa.
Freezing stops the microbes in soil from breaking down organic matter. Todey says that this contributes to the quality of Iowa's dark, rich cropland. Soils father south, where it's warmer, lose organic matter because bacteria, fungi and other critters keep munching through it all winter long.
Todey says another problem is when the temperature warms after a hard frost and then rain falls onto frozen ground. That's bad because it can cause soil to wash away.
A freeze can also help protect future crops.
""There are certain pests and diseases that cannot survive cold temperatures. They simply die off,"" says Rick Cruse, a soil scientist at Iowa State University. But ""as the temperature warms, there's more of those that survive.""
Warm winters are even worse for certain fruit and nut trees, which require chill hours during the winter. If they don't get enough of those, they won't produce the following season.
Michigan's cherry trees have struggled with erratic winter weather. And the repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the 2018-2019 winter, among other weather anomalies, destroyed Iowa's chestnut crop last year.
Peter Boulay of the Minnesota State Climatology Office says warming can also be a challenge for ice fishing, a sport that draws thousands of anglers.
He says some Minnesota lakes froze up early last fall, but then a mid-November warming compromised the ice. Heavy snow on top of that led to slushy conditions that aren't conducive to safe fishing. Then January brought some nights with overnight lows as much as 10 degrees above normal.
Some Minnesotans are cutting the season short.
But Boulay says where there is solid ice, temperatures in the 20s or even 30s can be welcome. ""It's not very comfortable sitting on a bucket when it's below zero.""
MOUNTAIN WEST
The most visible impact of warming winters in the Mountain West is on the forests. Millions of trees have died from pine, spruce and pinyon ips bark beetles over the past three decades.
Normally, bark beetles die off in freezing temperatures. ""When you have periods of temperature that do not reach the lethal level for the insects, that's when you start seeing increased survival of the population,"" says Jose Negron, a research entomologist with the U.S. Forest Service.
Warmer temperatures and record-low precipitation can also make trees more susceptible to infestation. The most damaged areas are in and around Rocky Mountain National Park and parts of the San Juan Mountains, the West Elk Mountains and the Sawatch Range.
""Forty to 50 percent of the mature spruce in the state has been killed during the epidemic,"" says Seth Davis, an assistant professor of forestry at Colorado State University. Davis' recent study found that warmer winter temperatures meant slightly bigger spruce beetles that emerged earlier and flew around longer.
While beetle outbreaks of this size have happened in the past, warmer temperatures might have an impact on their frequency. The impacts are complex, says Davis, but not necessarily all negative. Fewer trees mean more light reaches the forest floor, where flowers now grow. His research finds this is benefiting bee populations.
Another noticeable impact of warmer winters is on the region's important ski industry.
""Thanksgiving was a relatively dependable ski time, and that's not true anymore,"" says Jim White, a professor at the University of Colorado. As fall lasts longer and spring comes earlier, ""the natural snow is not as abundant,"" he says, and resorts lose valuable days to make their own. What's more, he says, ""the longer-term trend is for less and less snow.""
Ski areas at lower elevations, as in California, feel these changes the most. ""They're the ones that are going to be seeing, really, a loss of skiing altogether in 50 years or more,"" White says.
Colorado is lucky to have some of the highest elevations for skiing in the United States. Despite an overall warm winter, this year's snowpack is great for skiing. But White says even higher-elevation resorts are vulnerable to big changes as climate models project increasingly warmer temperatures.
TEXAS
Bats in December. Bluebonnets in January. Butterflies in February.
The first two months of winter in Austin, Texas, were the second warmest in 122 years of records, according to Victor Murphy, climate service program manager with the National Weather Service, and that's upsetting some rhythms of the natural world.
December and January were 4.7 degrees warmer than the 30-year average, he says, and only one night — Dec. 19 — dipped down to freezing. ""That's quite a bit of warmth spread over quite a few days,"" says Murphy. ""It's pretty significant.""
In recent years, warmer winters have caused Texas' famed bluebonnet wildflowers to appear months before people expect to see them.
The climate shift also allows migrating monarch butterflies to survive in Texas later than usual.
""In cold winters, they'll have two or three sightings along the Gulf,"" says Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch. In a warm year, ""you'll get butterflies that are sighted from Florida all the way to over to the middle of Texas and even into the San Antonio, Austin area.""
The great migration of monarchs to Mexico already faces many pressures. Taylor thinks that continued warming during their breeding season and migration and over the winter may one day help end it altogether, leaving small ""islands"" of nonmigrating butterflies around the Gulf Coast.
Then there are the Mexican free-tailed bats that gather each year outside San Antonio, one of the world's largest bat colonies. They're also a nightly summer tourist attraction in downtown Austin.
""They shouldn't be here,"" says Austin wildlife officer Sarah Whitson. Most bats usually migrate to Mexico or become inactive in the fall, but she says more have stuck around longer the last several winters.
""It's great if there's food sources here throughout the winter,"" she says. But she worries what could become of the bats if a sudden cold snap kills off the bugs they eat.
Bats play a key role in agriculture, helping to control pests and to fertilize and pollinate some crops. Changing migration patterns could also hurt crops that depend on them, creating what scientists call a ""mismatch.""
Researchers are seeing more mismatches as a result of climate change, says Norma Fowler, a biology professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""You can get plants that bloom before the pollinators are available,"" she says. ""You can get birds that come north before the insects are out for them to eat.""
ALASKA
On Alaska's western coast, thick winter sea ice has long protected remote villages from storms. But that ice cover has been freezing later and shrinking to record lows, allowing strong waves to eat away at land made fragile by thawing permafrost. After years of struggle, the village of Newtok late last year started moving residents to safer ground farther inland.
Inupiat on Alaska's North Slope use sea ice as a platform from which to hunt bowhead whales and walruses. Diminished ice in the Arctic is making those harvests more difficult.
Poor ice formation is also making it riskier for Alaskans who rely on ice roads, built on some of the state's rural rivers during winter, to move freight and other goods. In recent years, residents have blamed warm temperatures for the deaths of a number of people whose snowmobiles or all-terrain vehicles fell through thin ice.
The state's oil industry needs hundreds of miles of ice roads over land for its operations, which are specially designed for freezing conditions. Companies are investing in technology to help them cope with steadily shrinking winters.
Alaska had an unusually cold January this year, but the state is warming twice as fast as the global average. In Anchorage, a city defined by its winters, this means residents are recalibrating their relationship with the coldest season.
The winter started off warm, disappointing cross-country skiers who can normally use dozens of miles of trails in the city's parks. At a major high school race in December, skiers competed on a mile-long stretch of man-made snow that wound through grass and ice.
""Normal now is kind of like this,"" said fourth-place finisher Max Beiergrohslein. ""On again, off again, there is snow and then there isn't.""
Alaska scientists are researching midwinter temperature swings, trying to track how much of a change there has been in what are known as ""rain on snow"" events, which create ice. Amid a particularly slick start to this winter, one Anchorage elementary school principal suggested that students wear helmets to recess, to protect them from falls on an icy playground.
Meanwhile, winter activities that require less snow, like fat-tire bicycling and ice skating on wilderness lakes, are gaining popularity.

** Climate Change May Make The Snapping Shrimp Snap Louder : NPR **

* https://www.npr.org/2020/02/27/809741307/climate-change-may-make-the-snapping-shrimp-snap-louder *



      Lauren Sommer
    

Tiny snapping shrimp are among of the loudest animals in the ocean. And climate change could be making them louder, which affects a lot of other sea life.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: 
See if you can guess what this sound is.
(SOUNDBITE OF CRACKLING)
KELLY: Bacon frying, maybe a crackling fire? Nope, it is underwater snapping shrimp. They're only a few inches long but among the loudest animals in the ocean. Thanks to climate change, they are getting even louder. That's according to new research. And that could affect a lot of other sea life, as NPR's Lauren Sommer reports.
LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Dive into tropical seas and that crackly sound is hard to miss.
(SOUNDBITE OF SHRIMP CRACKLING)
ARAN MOONEY: Oh, yeah. You can hear them very easily. They tend to live in colonies where they're somewhat clustered closely together, so you hear this chorus of them.
SOMMER: Aran Mooney is a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who studies some of the many snapping shrimp species around the world. He says that sound comes from their one massive claw.
MOONEY: And they can really close that claw really, really fast, and it makes a bubble in the water. And when that bubble implodes, that's what makes the pop or the snap.
SOMMER: It even creates a tiny flash of light, and it's surprisingly loud.
MOONEY: Really similar to a large ship or a large whale or even some sort of, like, underwater hammering.
SOMMER: During World War II, researchers were sent to investigate the noise because it was interfering with the sonar the Navy used to find submarines. Mooney and his colleagues looked at snapping shrimp in a lab and the wild and found that the warmer it gets, the louder the shrimp are and the more they snap. Warmer water makes them more active, as Mooney recently presented to the American Geophysical Union. And oceans are warming with climate change, says Steve Simpson.
STEVE SIMPSON: When we look at any type of global change, what we realize is that there will be winners and losers.
SOMMER: Simpson is a professor of marine biology at the University of Exeter. He says sound is incredibly important underwater because it's hard to see very far, and oceans are already getting noisier because of human impacts.
SIMPSON: Fifty thousand ships sailing around the world carrying 90% of world trade.
SOMMER: Add louder shrimp to that noise, and it could further stress other animals that use sound, like fish.
(SOUNDBITE OF CRACKLING, GRUNTING)
KELLY: That grunt is a sergeant major, a small Atlantic coral reef fish.
SIMPSON: It could mask the ability of fish to be able to communicate because it will create a higher noise floor, this crackling sound that then swamps any of the sounds that they might be wanting to listen out for.
SOMMER: But there's also a chance that louder shrimp could help other organisms. Simpson says when fish, clams and coral are young larvae, they're free-swimming, floating in the ocean current.
SIMPSON: They're ready to find a reef to go and make their home, and they use the sound that's coming from that community as a cue to find a place to settle.
SOMMER: The sound of snapping shrimp is an advertisement that that reef is a good place to live, which is why Simpson and other scientists will be watching the ocean's soundscape closely at a time when so many things are changing.

Smoke from chemical fires at a Houston-area facility owned by the company Arkema, which flooded during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Trailers and storage containers that burned in the fires released soot and other air pollution.
That's the central question of an unprecedented lawsuit against a company whose chemical plant flooded during Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Containers and trailers there caught fire, sending up a column of black smoke above the facility for days. Now Arkema (the company), an executive, and the local plant manager are facing criminal charges —  recklessly emitting air pollution, and a third employee with assault. Rebecca's latest reporting on the case is here.

** A Checkup On California's Efforts To Combat Climate Change : NPR **

* https://www.npr.org/2020/03/15/815828879/tracking-californias-2030-climate-goals *



      Hannah Hagemann
    

California has some of the most aggressive climate policies in the country. The state has had both successes and challenges in meeting its ambitious climate goals.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: 
A checkup now on attempts to address climate change. California is the fifth-largest economy in the world. And it has some of the most aggressive climate policies in the country. It passed a landmark law 14 years ago to slash greenhouse gas emissions. It's also one of the first states to set a goal of going completely carbon neutral. For many, California has been held up as a model. But is it? NPR's Hannah Hagemann joins us now to take a closer look. Hi, Hannah.
HANNAH HAGEMANN, BYLINE: Hey, Lulu.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. Let's tick through a couple of things. Let's look at energy. How is California doing?
HAGEMANN: So the big emission cuts we've seen there so far - those have mostly come from getting off coal. From 2004 to 2006, coal was about 20% of the total electricity mix. And in 2018, it was only a little more than 3%.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's good.
HAGEMANN: Yeah. And that happened for a couple of reasons. California committed to this huge goal of getting greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels. There was support from the Obama administration. And wind and solar prices came way down. So because of all that, Danny Cullenward, a researcher at Stanford Law School, told me that there is a clearer path to decarbonise electricity versus other industries.
DANNY CULLENWARD: The technologies that cut the emissions are things we have and we know how to work with. That's installing solar plants. That's installing wind plants. That's putting in battery energy storage systems. And we have the right policies and tools to get it done. And that's less true in some of the other sectors.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So energy good - but he's mentioning these other sectors. And I'm assuming one of those is transportation. I'm thinking of electric cars. I know California's done a lot. What's going on there?
HAGEMANN: Actually, over the last years, vehicle emissions have inched up.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Up?
HAGEMANN: Yeah. And that's because the number of people super-commuting up to 90 minutes each way - that's increased. That's one part of the equation. And another thing, too - a record number of Californians have cars - about 80 out of every hundred.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. You mentioned commuting. This week, it's all about telecommuting as people try to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
HAGEMANN: Yeah. That's true. And we don't know how long this will last. But there's other issues at hand. I talked with Daniel Sperling - he's a member of the California Air Resources Board - about this thing he called the Amazon Prime effect.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: What is that?
HAGEMANN: Wanting more things delivered fast - that means lots of trips from warehouses to neighborhoods. And at the end of the day, that's meant an uptick in truck emissions, which are the worst for the environment.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what about just putting people closer to work so that they don't have to super-commute?
HAGEMANN: Yeah. That's easier said than done. And lawmakers have tried to address that by putting through various policies to build denser housing closer to city centers. They haven't been successful so far, though. There's also the question of, do people even really want to live in high rises and cities, even if it does mean shorter commutes? So kind of back to where we started, Lulu - the state is really pushing for people to buy more electric vehicles. Here's Sperling.
DANIEL SPERLING: We're kind of on the path. We just need to add a lot more urgency and move faster.
HAGEMANN: So California has this goal of getting 5 million zero-emission vehicles on the road in 10 years. And in October of last year, there are about 655,000 of these cars on the road. Sperling says there are some state-level incentives. But there need to be more to get more people to buy EVs. Last thing is there needs to be a lot more charging infrastructure.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: But if you put all these incentives in, is that really enough to widely motivate Californians to buy EVs?
HAGEMANN: Yeah. That gets at the heart of the challenge. I talked to Javier Castellanos (ph). He's a native Californian. And he commutes from Whittier, Calif., to Santa Ana - about an hour and a half each way. He drives a used Honda Civic that runs on natural gas. He bought it a couple of years ago to try and reduce his impact. But now the car doesn't meet the state's clean car standards. He wants to buy a newer EV. But it's still too much for him at this point. And he feels like people like him are being left behind.
JAVIER CASTELLANOS: Latinos and people of color - we're the guys that drive all the way from East LA to West LA. And we're not getting any love in terms of getting support to getting these cars. So if this is really about the environment, which it's supposed to be about, then why are you ostracizing your big majority of people that are on the road more than anyone else?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what's your big takeaway here when you look at how a state like California, which really has made this front and center, is struggling so much?
HAGEMANN: I mean, with a state like California, they put up a lot of money to try and make these things happen. At the same time, there's been a real slowdown of federal effort. So now California is making progress to meet its goals. But it might be going too slow.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's Hannah Hagemann. Thank you so much.
HAGEMANN: Thank you, Lulu.

ALIX SPIEGEL, HOST: 
The human animal averages 60 to 100 heartbeats a minute. To me, that's like the Goldilocks heartbeat - not too fast, not too slow, just right - you know, as heartbeats go.
(SOUNDBITE OF HUMAN HEART BEATING)
SPIEGEL: So steady and reassuring.
(SOUNDBITE OF HUMAN HEART BEATING)
SPIEGEL: But then there's the black-capped chickadee, which beats 480 times a minute - a tempo so fast just listening to it makes me feel nervous.
(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD HEART BEATING)
SPIEGEL: I don't mean to be judgey (ph), but I feel like it would suck to have the heartbeat of a Black-capped chickadee, like drinking a truck full of 5-Hour Energy drinks every single day of your life.
(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD HEART BEATING)
SPIEGEL: Someone told me recently that the tempo of most animal heartbeats is related to size - how big an animal is, how small. The bigger the scale of the animal, the slower the tempo of its heart, like the elephant, which clocks in at a chill 30 heartbeats a minute.
(SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT HEART BEATING)
SPIEGEL: Most of the time, we don't think a lot about tempo - how fast or slow something goes - or scale - how big or small something is - so we're mostly unaware of how tempo and scale affect things. But recently, I've been talking to this unusual group of people who've made me think about those two things a lot. And I've come to understand how important scale and tempo are in determining what happens in the world, how profoundly they, right now, are influencing my life and your life and the lives of everyone we love.
So that's what we want to talk about today - tempo and scale and what they have to tell us about the world that's coming.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
HANNA ROSIN, HOST: 
This is INVISIBILIA. I'm Hanna Rosin.
SPIEGEL: And I'm Alix Spiegel.
ROSIN: Welcome to our new season, Seven Hail Marys, stories about people who come up with improbable work arounds to desperate problems. We look at disinformation, race, politics.
SPIEGEL: And like so many podcasts before us, we give you important information about what it might have been like to sit in the hull of a Greek sailing ship during the time of Homer.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: So Alix is going to be telling the story today. It's about one of the biggest problems humankind has ever faced and a big idea being proposed to help deal with it.
SPIEGEL: It's so hard to know where to start this story. Do you start with the guy who stumbled across the secret military recordings or the man who grew up playing in toxic sludge in New Jersey? Or maybe you start with a wildly successful technologist, maybe the one who estimates that his innovation wastes the equivalent of 200,000 lifetimes a day.
I don't know. I guess the only thing you really need to know at this point is that this is a story about four men who've joined together to pursue what will likely first strike you as a completely preposterous idea. Is it, in fact, preposterous? Plenty say yes; plenty say no. What's clear is that they've committed themselves to this somewhat bizarre undertaking because they sincerely hope that it will wake you up in time for you to take in the massive train moving steadily down the tracks in your direction. Now, I don't know if it will wake you up, if this thing they're planning will work as a catalyst for massive change like they hope, but that is clearly their goal.
Anyway, I figured out who I'm going to start with. I'm going with a guy who grew up next to a river of waste in New Jersey 'cause he helped organize this whole thing. His name is David Gruber.
DAVID GRUBER: I grew up in an industrial area of New Jersey. It's right on the banks of the Passaic River, which is one of the most polluted rivers in the U.S. It was actually a Superfund site - super degraded environment. We had this perfume factory in our backyard. And it (ph) would wake up and it would just stink from cheap perfume.
SPIEGEL: The river behind David Gruber's home was an environmental contamination zone. So in his neighborhood, the words cancer cluster were familiar even to young kids like him. But to David, that didn't matter. He loved it. The factories were his stickball court, the Superfund site his playground.
GRUBER: I would still swim in this river - in the Passaic River. That was my first experience with nature. And to me, it was amazing. Right? I would - there was little fish in it. There was little crustaceans. There was - when I would come out of it, all these little crawly things would be on my shirt.
SPIEGEL: Little things and their close cousins even tinier things were David's obsession. He could spend hours watching tiny beings squirm out their lives in the mud. But for some unfathomable reason, no one else seemed to get the appeal. His friends liked human-scale stuff - girls and beers and television shows. And even the few other nature lovers he encountered weren't down for the very small. This was the early '80s, and the world was going crazy for whales - everyone falling all over themselves to save these magnificent creatures. But whales left David cold.
GRUBER: Honestly, I almost veered away from whales because they're the charismatic megafauna. And you know, I was into - I wanted - I was into the weird animals - you know, the animals that nobody knew about. They're more obscure. It's almost like someone who likes weird bands. The whale community was like pop culture, and I was into the underground life scene.
SPIEGEL: Sadly, the world had so little interest in the microscopic beings David loved that most of the time, it didn't even bother to notice them and so, in his view, had no idea of their incredible power, beauty and scale.
So David set out to rectify this problem. In 2007, he got a Ph.D. in marine microbiology and immediately started publishing papers cataloging the many virtues of the tiny beings that surround us. But no matter how many virtues he catalogued, no one seemed that impressed.
GRUBER: Microbiologists, like, we feel these animals are so important. We love them so deeply, but we can't seem to get anyone except other microbiologists interested in them.
SPIEGEL: Why, do you think?
GRUBER: It's because we can't relate to them, you know? How do you fall in love with pond scum?
SPIEGEL: To bring them to life for the rest of us, David even co-wrote a book with a protein as his main character. Unfortunately, David jokes, it only sold like 13 copies - not exactly a blockbuster.
It is hard when your main character is a protein.
GRUBER: Yeah, it's incredibly hard.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Worse, in the course of studying all these incredibly small things, David became aware of a very big problem. You see, much of his research involved organisms that exist in and around coral reefs. And it was impossible to ignore what was happening there.
GRUBER: It's not like, oh, they're slowly getting worse. Like, I would go back to places I'd been a year or two before and they would be totally changed - just dead. It's just dead - 5% of the fish on the reef.
SPIEGEL: It was obvious to David that climate change was moving much faster than most scientists had anticipated. But it was also obvious to him that communicating that to the public was near to impossible. I mean, you could tell people stuff like the coral reefs were faltering, but it was hard to understand what that actually meant if you didn't have a whole bunch of very complicated context.
GRUBER: It's about understanding the timescale because if you put this into perspective of billions of years and the evolution of these systems and how they've changed and then you think of the compressed nature of 10, 15 years, that's where it gets really scary. Like, we are incredibly threatened, and we don't really even know it yet.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: In a way, David was kind of like that little boy character in ""The Sixth Sense."" He saw plainly a ghostly threat hovering in the world, but most people couldn't see it, in this case, because the problem didn't happen at the right scale and tempo for them - a scale and tempo that naturally activates human response.
When a problem is fast enough and close enough - a car crash, a punch in the face - you respond immediately. That's just how you're wired. But when it's too slow or far away, like climate change, it feels so abstract, it's hard to motivate. There are, after all, so many other more pressing concerns. So no matter how much David waved his arms to get attention, no one seemed appropriately panicked. And David began to struggle with an overwhelming sense of hopelessness.
GRUBER: I can't, with an honest face, keep going out and swimming and studying and taking measurements and showing that the corals are declining every year. I can't keep doing that and feeling like it's not having an impact. It's just heartbreaking.
SPIEGEL: David began to think seriously about walking away. He thought he would drop out, move to Hawaii, open a surf shop and focus on happiness.
GRUBER: There's a great analogy among mammals, at least - we have a finite number of times in our lifetime that our heart is going to beat. And how do we want to spend those beats? You know, do I want to spend these beats, like, fighting a battle that I'm inevitably going to lose? Or do I want to spend those beats, you know, sitting in the sanctuary of nature that still exists, you know, go - buying a plot of land somewhere and just being with it?
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: If he was going to stay and fight, David decided he needed a totally new approach - something radical that could break through the tempo-scale barrier and really wake people up.
(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)
SPIEGEL: But before I tell you about that - and I promise I will tell you about that - I need to explain the story of Roger Payne, one of the people that David eventually partnered with.
ROGER PAYNE: Hello.
SPIEGEL: Hi. Can we come in?
PAYNE: Come in.
SPIEGEL: Hi.
PAYNE: Enter, enter.
SPIEGEL: Roger is a scientist who now lives in the backwoods of Vermont. And a long time ago, Roger encountered a problem very similar to the one David struggled with - the problem of people not seeing a tragedy in the natural world that was perfectly plain to him. And through sheer bravado and grit, Roger concocted a deeply unconventional but weirdly successful response. It all began one day in 1966, when Roger was in a lab at Tufts University and decided to turn on the news.
PAYNE: Listening to the radio and I heard an announcement that there was a whale that had come ashore.
SPIEGEL: Roger was excited. He'd never seen a whale in the flesh before. At the time, he was studying moths.
PAYNE: And I thought - ooh, I want to see it. But I had other stuff to do. And by the time I got there, it was dark and everybody who had been on the beach had left. And it was raining. But I found the whale, and it turned out to be a dolphin - which is a form of whale. And somebody had cut the tail off this whale. Somebody else had carved their initials in its flank. And someone else had stuffed a cigar butt in its blowhole. And I stood looking at this beautiful creature. And at one point, my flashlight went out. But it was still gently, vaguely backlit by a kind of glow of the sky, and I could see its silhouette - beautiful curves of this creature. And it occurred to me that, you know, something - there's got to be something different.
SPIEGEL: Roger knew that many species of whales were on the verge of being hunted to extinction, just barely holding on. And from Roger's perspective, the problem was clear - people couldn't see whales properly.
See, at this moment in history - 1966 - whales were not yet the international sensation of a megafauna microbiologist David Gruber found so irritating. Whales appeared as soap, oil or a tedious assignment in your 10th-grade English class but otherwise didn't show up that much in the average human life because whales are enormous animals that move through their lives at a completely different tempo over vast and far-flung oceans. So of course, people couldn't really see what they were.
PAYNE: It was clear to me that whoever had stuffed the cigar butt in the blowhole, they were entertaining each other. They didn't even see the animal as far as I could tell. I mean, it's that kind of complete just inattention. And I made the decision at that moment to study whales and try to find out things about them would capture the fancy of humanity.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: After that, Roger and his collaborator and wife at the time, Katy Payne, started taking trips south, searching for a good spot to observe whales. And during one trip to Bermuda, Roger encountered a man who worked for the Navy, named Frank Watlington, in the engine room of a ship. As the boat's diesel generator roared in the background, Frank screamed out that he had this really interesting recording he'd made while working for the military. Apparently, his job was to eavesdrop on the Soviets using a powerful underwater microphone.
PAYNE: Frank took a tape out of his pocket. He threaded it across the heads of his recorder. He had some headphones. He put them on my head. And then, in order to be heard over the roaring of this generator, he said, I think these are whales - very loudly (laughter).
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALES VOCALIZING)
PAYNE: I started listening to this sound and, my God, it was the most extraordinary, powerful sound I'd heard ever. And I remember my mind was racing as I listened to this. And I thought - this - this is the way. If only you can get these sounds into the ears and the brains of the world, that will steal the world's heart. That's what I thought.
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALES VOCALIZING)
SPIEGEL: Roger carried a copy of the recording and began an intense daily routine of listening. Over and over, he played the recording of the humpback whales singing.
PAYNE: In fact, I rigged up my primitive alarm clock so it would turn it on and wake me up in the morning. And I would lie during the first hours of consciousness with this thing sort of filtering through me. And because of that kind of exposure, I finally realized that it wasn't just some complex, you know, rigmarole of sounds - that it was, in fact, repeating itself, my God.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Turned out, whale song was structured in a way that was similar to human music. There was the statement of a theme, and then the theme developed. And like humans, the whales seemed very particular about their musical phrasing.
PAYNE: I don't sing (singing) glory, glory, hallelu - (inhaling) - yah, glore (ph)...
I tuck my breath in in order to not interrupt the performance of that singing.
SPIEGEL: Roger fell more and more in love with this music - so in love, he says he essentially dropped out of his official job for about two years and devoted himself to assembling the most emotionally powerful collection of whale song he could possibly scrape together.
PAYNE: And once I had enough recordings that I felt had enough emotional impact - and that's hard to do, by the way - then I thought, oh, I want to make a record.
SPIEGEL: Unfortunately, Roger had no idea how to make a record. He did, however, have a friend who worked at a book publishing house. They'd never pressed a record before, but Roger convinced him and then started literally cold-calling radio stations to see if they'd consider playing it on-air.
Just walk me through that phone call. It's like, hi, my name is Roger Payne, and I'm calling because I have a record of whale songs. Like, and the - to which they respond...
PAYNE: (Laughter) You have to get there faster. You have to say - whale songs, is that anything that might interest you?
SPIEGEL: Sometimes they hung up; sometimes he got lucky. But Roger wouldn't stop. He'd show up at concerts, talk his way backstage and then ask stars like Mary Hopkin, a Welsh singer famous for the hit ""Those Were The Days,"" to listen in between sets.
PAYNE: Her manager was, you know, mumbling things to her every few minutes - we got to go; come on; yes, yes, yes - you know. And she listened for the entire period between sets. And when she was done, she didn't remove her headphones. She wiped them slowly off her head while looking as if she was coming out of a trance and saying, that is the most beautiful sound I've ever heard in my life. I wish I could sound like a whale.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: It wasn't just Mary Hopkin. Judy Collins listened and decided to do her own song.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""FAREWELL TO TARWATHIE"")
JUDY COLLINS: (Singing) Farewell to Tarwathie...
SPIEGEL: Carl Sagan chose to include whale song on one of the records he launched with the Voyager spacecraft in 1977.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""FAREWELL TO TARWATHIE"")
COLLINS: (Singing) Whale song...
SPIEGEL: Roger cold-called his way onto ""Johnny Carson.""
(SOUNDBITE OF PAUL ANKA'S ""JOHNNY'S THEME"")
SPIEGEL: And perhaps most impressive of all - at least to me, given my childhood - whale song became a major plot point in the fourth ""Star Trek"" movie, ""The Voyage Home.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME"")
WILLIAM SHATNER: (As Kirk) Spock.
LEONARD NIMOY: (As Spock) As suspected, the probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
SHATNER: (As Kirk) Whales.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Now, decades of whale research hasn't been able to determine precisely what, if anything, whales are saying with their songs. But still, people were mesmerized - why? Roger thinks it's because in the voice of the whale, they heard something they recognized - themselves. Humpback whale song exists at a tempo and scale that humans can relate to. It sounds almost human.
You can listen, as Mary Hopkin did, and say to yourself, that is what I do, only better. In fact, Roger believes that what people hear in whale song is a kind of distilled version of the most powerful part of human communication - emotion, which is why they're so taken with it.
PAYNE: There are lots of people whose reaction to hearing whales sing is to weep.
(SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' ""LINA MY QUEEN"")
SPIEGEL: And here's the point. Once Roger helped make whales and their culture more visible to humans, people did respond. They started crying out more forcefully for the whale to be protected and the Save the Whales movement gained momentum.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The song of the humpback whale has become an anthem of sorts.
UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Mr. Chairman, I'm here today to represent the children of the United States.
SPIEGEL: ""Songs Of The Humpback Whale"" was played for congressional committees, at U.N. conferences...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: A lot of my friends and I are worried that when we grow up and have children of our own, there won't be any more sea animals to see.
SPIEGEL: ...Until ultimately, it helped public opinion shift enough that the International Whaling Commission felt pressured to rewrite its rules. In 1982, the IWC decided to implement a moratorium on commercial whale hunting. And though a few nations objected to the ban, once it passed, some important whale populations around the world did begin to bounce back.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)
SUSAN STAMBERG: A big step towards saving the whale was taken today in London.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: And it's being called a victory for conservationists.
SPIEGEL: Roger had used an unlikely method to address the same problem David Gruber had - he'd seen the natural world threatened, and he'd used the voice of the animal itself to make people see things in a new way. The only problem was that eventually people got numb to the idea of whale song. It was no longer strange and amazing. It was assumed. ""Songs Of The Humpback"" whale became part of our cultural wallpaper - a funny, somewhat cheap thing - a plot point in a ""Star Trek"" movie.
PAYNE: People now don't - they don't know it. They haven't heard it, most of them. It's rare to find somebody who's heard it. Used to be - well, for a while, it was rare to find somebody who hadn't if they were young. But now, nope, not anymore.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""FAREWELL TO TARWATHIE"")
COLLINS: (Singing) In hunting the whale.
SPIEGEL: But even though the power of whale song had faded, the need for it remained. As Roger watched climate change accelerate, threatening not just whales but thousands and thousands of other species, he, like David Gruber, felt a growing despair.
The question was, could there be a contemporary version of ""Songs Of The Humpback Whale""? maybe something so shocking it was able to cut through our inability to see and relate to the natural world in an even bigger way. That was the question. Could someone find a new version? And what in the world would that be?
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: NPR's INVISIBILIA will return in a minute.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: This is INVISIBILIA from NPR. I'm Hanna Rosin.
Alix now continues her story of four people who've banded together to pursue a project they hope will change the world. She now introduces us to the last two members of the group. They're technologists so expert at using computers to manipulate time and space that they actually helped determine the tempo and scale of the world a lot of us live in now. They're friends, and their names are Britt Selvitelle and Aza Raskin.
BRITT SELVITELLE: So this was the Twitter building.
SPIEGEL: Oh, wow, this was the Twitter building.
On a small side street in San Francisco, there's a squat, unimpressive building made of painted gray cement. It's the home of the very first Twitter office, and it's where Britt and Aza met back in the days when Twitter was, like, eight people working on this thing that no one had ever heard of.
SELVITELLE: In this era, there was a page on the front of Twitter that you could click on that was all the tweets. And it scrolled in real time, and you could watch as they came in - one tweet, two tweets.
SPIEGEL: It was Britt, not Aza, who worked at Twitter. He was part of the founding team. And though it wasn't at all obvious that the tempo of tweets populating Twitter's homepage would increase to the point where this thing they were trying would actually succeed, the handful of people working there still behaved as if they were building God's own sanctum.
SELVITELLE: It was a very serious, surprisingly somber space. And that's why when I saw Aza, it lit me up.
SPIEGEL: Aza was the opposite of somber. Aza doesn't walk - he bounces. At 19, Aza helped write a physics textbook. At 21, he founded the first of three extremely successful technology companies. But he's probably best known for something he did in 2006 at age 22. While sitting in a cafe, he came up with an ingenious idea to help us all move faster through the online world. He invented infinite scroll.
See, at the time, all webpages functioned like real world pages. They had a top and a bottom, and you'd click at the bottom to get a new page to load. But that afternoon in the cafe, Aza decided that eliminating this lag time would be of benefit to society.
AZA RASKIN: Fewer clicks, less trains of thought lost, more better information found - more faster, more better.
SPIEGEL: Problem was, infinite scroll was the technological equivalent of removing clocks and windows from a casino. It removed the signals that helped people stop - made them forget time. Seven years later, in a small hotel room in Helsinki, Aza sat down with a pen and some paper and calculated that, conservatively, this one invention was responsible for wasting more than 200,000 lifetimes a day.
But that was not how it felt at the time. Back then, Aza believed - as Britt believed - that technology would change the world for the better by getting rid of gatekeepers, connecting people directly and making everything faster and more efficient. And it was astonishing, both to Britt and to Aza, the change that they could engineer. The first thing Britt worked on at Twitter was creating what is now known as the like button. And then, of course, there was the retweet.
SELVITELLE: Which didn't exist - right? - like, that was a thing that we had to create that allowed somebody else to spread an idea out into the open just through the press of a button. A tiny change to a couple of lines of code and a piece of software can impact the entire world at scale. Like, these were the waters that we were swimming in at the time.
SPIEGEL: And for a while, it looked like it was all working out great. Small tweaks to lines of code seemed capable of toppling dictatorships in the Middle East...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting, unintelligible).
SELVITELLE: Wow, wow.
SPIEGEL: ...Connecting activists at home.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Black lives matter.
SELVITELLE: This is unbelievable.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Black lives matter.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting, unintelligible).
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: But as time wore on, it became increasingly clear that the shift in social dynamics they'd helped engineer had consequences they'd never anticipated.
(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously...
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: State of emergency in Charlottesville today as white nationalists clash...
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: One person is dead.
TRUMP: You know what Sharia is?
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Send her back.
SPIEGEL: Britt started waking up in the morning with a strange feeling in his body.
SELVITELLE: A tightness in the chest.
SPIEGEL: Aza felt a similar unease.
RASKIN: I think I helped work on a set of tools that is creating this outcome.
SPIEGEL: Britt quit Twitter. Aza went through what he calls his long dark night of the soul. In part, they felt distressed about the future because their dream of a faster, more connected world had produced some alarming outcomes. But also, like David and Roger, they felt increasingly anxious about the natural world.
RASKIN: We're all feeling the first flame licks of global climate change. And the question is, what can we do about it?
SPIEGEL: It was during his long dark night period that Aza started reading the climate change research - study after study - and they were frightening - surveys estimating that 200 species of plant, insect, mammal and bird became extinct every 24 hours. That's more than a thousand times the normal extinction rate, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Then there was the research demonstrating that in part because of climate change, Germany had lost three-quarters of its flying insects since 1989. The insects were just gone.
RASKIN: What those papers really did for me was it said, hey, things are going to change. The world in 10 years is going to be very different than now. It's OK to start grieving for the world we're about to lose because that makes space for seeing clearly so that we can start doing something about it.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Then one day, about three years ago, Aza and Britt were hanging at Britt's house, and they stumbled across what they thought that something could be. Aza had been talking to Britt about this story that he'd heard on the news a while back - on NPR, actually. It was about animal communication, specifically this type of monkey that made all kinds of very distinct sounds. So this researcher was painstakingly cataloguing them because, in her opinion, the sounds seemed a lot like human speech.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: And that's when Aza had this kind of crazy thought.
RASKIN: Shouldn't we be able to, like, use machine learning to decode what they're saying?
SPIEGEL: Machine learning - basically, algorithms that teach themselves to perform a task or understand a thing by scouring reams of data and identifying patterns in that massive wash of information. Over the years, machines have taught themselves all kinds of amazing things using these methods. But in 2017, a truly remarkable thing happened in the space of machine learning - truly remarkable.
It all started when some clever computer scientists created a program which took all the words in the English language and had the computer use them to create this image.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Picture in your head a three-dimensional cloud of tiny dots hovering in space. Each of the hovering dots represents a word in the English language. Aza showed me the image on his computer. The dots looked like a collection of stars.
RASKIN: To me, this looks like a galaxy. It looks like stars. And it's - there are some areas that have dense sets of clouds of words and other areas that don't. It looks like a galaxy.
SPIEGEL: The important thing to know is that each of the tiny dot-stars hovering in space, they're not just randomly placed.
RASKIN: Where the stars are in this galaxy depends on how the concepts relate to each other.
SPIEGEL: Let's give you an example.
RASKIN: There's a point in this cloud which is the word man, and there's a point in this cloud which is the word king.
SPIEGEL: Of course, since this is the whole English language, there is also a point in the cloud representing woman and a point in the cloud representing queen. And what you see when you look more closely is that the placement of the man point relative to the king point is the exact same as the placement of the woman point relative to the queen point.
RASKIN: The distance and direction from man to king is the same as the distance and direction from woman to queen is the same as the distance from girl to princess.
Man, king.
AUTOMATED VOICE: Woman, queen.
RASKIN: Girl, princess.
So we're starting to see analogies represented geometrically. You can actually just do arithmetic. You do princess minus girl plus man, and that just equals king.
SPIEGEL: Pretty cool, right?
RASKIN: But it's way deeper than that.
SPIEGEL: Turns out that if you represent language geometrically in this way, you can do all sorts of interesting things - a new kind of math with words.
RASKIN: If you take smelly minus malodorous - well, malodorous is sort of the pretentious way, you could say, of saying smelly. And so this ends up giving you the pretentiousness factor. So now you can add pretentiousness to book, and that just equals tome. And then add it to clever, and that just equals adroit. So you're really starting to, like, get some rich understanding of what language and the world that we see with language is.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Actually, remember how I told you to visualize a three-dimensional cloud? I only said that to make it easy for you. The reality is that the cloud is 300 dimensions. Can you imagine anything in 300 dimensions? Neither can I.
Anyway, from 2013 to 2017, this whole visualized language as a geometrical shape made of tiny dots thing was simply amusing, and people like Aza and Britt could use it to do all kinds of parlor tricks.
RASKIN: How about hipster minus authenticity plus conservative? And the computer spat out electability.
SPIEGEL: But while people like Britt and Aza were having fun, things progressed. German was turned into a cloud of points. French was turned into a cloud of points; Japanese. And then in 2017, the truly remarkable thing happened. Someone took the Japanese cloud shape and superimposed it on the German cloud shape.
RASKIN: Someone was able to take one shape and just rotate it on top of the other - just see, like, how similar are the shapes of Japanese and German? And most linguists, AI people - almost everyone thought that languages are so different, that cultures are so different, the way that we see the world is so different that this couldn't possibly work.
SPIEGEL: But you know what? It did work. Underneath it all, the shapes were the same, which meant that you no longer needed dictionaries. All you needed were clouds of dots to make a translation.
RASKIN: You get a pretty good word-for-word translation. And the crazy thing is it doesn't work for just Japanese and German but also for English and Esperanto and Turkish and Finnish, which is a really weird language. The AI community has now tried this with over a hundred languages so far. And they all seem to share, if you sort of blur your eyes, a kind of universal human meaning shape.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: I'd like to spend one small minute on the beauty of this idea because there is so much ugliness in the world that when we stumble across something beautiful, I think we should pause to acknowledge it. Underneath all of our massive and important cultural differences, we are so similar that all you have to do is blur your eyes a little to translate from one language to another. We all have people that we love and people that we hate. We all have our own kind of kings and queens and pretty much everything else. To me, that is profound - that underneath everything, there's a kind of giant, universal Rubik's Cube, and if you slot it into place, the coloring might be different, but suddenly, everything is order because people are mostly the same.
Essentially, what the technology of machine learning does is fix a scale problem. It takes the whole ocean and turns it into a glass of water so that suddenly, we can see the shape of an entire language and how all the languages in the world actually make the same shape.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Which was why, as Aza explained to Britt during their fateful hang out at Britt's house, he was so excited when he heard that NPR story about the researcher focused on the monkey communication.
RASKIN: Shouldn't we be able to, like, use machine learning to decode what they're saying?
SPIEGEL: Because he suddenly realized it might be possible to take a bunch of recordings of monkey talk, feed them into a computer and produce a new kind of cloud. Computers could do it with German, Japanese, Swahili. Why not animal communication? And if you did, what would the cloud look like?
RASKIN: What kind of shape is that? And does it fit anywhere into the universal human meaning shape? And if it does, then you start to be able to piece together a kind of Rosetta Stone.
SPIEGEL: And if it does, then maybe - just maybe - you could begin to decode animal communication. What is language, after all? Simply a model of the world, our map of the reality we experience. And when you think about it, some of the realities that humans and animals experience are kind of similar. Both have mothers, fathers, siblings, feel pain, fear, sexual interest.
SELVITELLE: There's an intuition that because we share certain experiences in the world, there are parts of the shapes that might overlap.
SPIEGEL: Now, there are many, many giant leaps of logic subtly embedded in the idea that you could use these new technologies to decode animal communication - many. And I am going to explore them in detail shortly. But Aza and Britt seem to believe that it's possible, and that even if you don't ultimately succeed in an actual translation, the very act of producing a cloud will give you all kinds of information about animal life and psychology that you did not have before.
RASKIN: First, you're going to get a sense of scale. Like, is this shape a really small shape? Are there few points? Or is it a really big shape? Does it fit more - does it look more like, say, the kind of shape that baby babble looks like? Or maybe, like, as kids grow, they get bigger and bigger vocabularies, and so you can sort of track, like, how big this shape is. You get a sense of complexity. So even before you start to translate, you actually start to learn a lot about what this shape is.
SPIEGEL: Which would allow you to determine what Aza and Britt see as a vitally important thing.
RASKIN: We're turning to a computer to ask the question agnostically. Is this thing - animal vocalizations - is this language?
SPIEGEL: Do some animals have a language-shaped cloud?
RASKIN: And if it's language, that says something really deep, political about us and our place in the world.
SPIEGEL: Because if animals have language, then we will likely see them in a very different way. It's the exact same intuition that Roger had about whales. He used whale song - the actual voice of the animal communicating - to help humans understand whales had a complex culture similar in important ways to our own. That's also what Britt and Aza wanted to do.
RASKIN: If you look at, like, these movements where there is a sort of a social awakening, they happened when groups that didn't have voice gained voice because that's true for the LGBTQ movement, for women's suffrage, for the civil rights movement.
(SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' ""DONNALEE"")
SPIEGEL: To me, this feels like a bank-shot approach to the problem of climate change. And obviously, not every group that raises its voice is listened to. But there's no denying that Britt and Aza have an impressive track record of influencing behavior on a mass scale. And they maintain that if people can hear animals in a new way, it will serve as a catalyst, like the napalm girl photo during Vietnam - or maybe, come to think of it, like ""Songs Of The Humpback Whale.""
(SOUNDBITE OF FRANK WATLINGTON'S ""SOLO WHALE"")
SPIEGEL: So this is the completely preposterous idea that the four men you've heard from have gathered around. They've banded together to translate whale communication. How they managed to find each other is a little complicated, but I'll give you the short version.
David, the microbiologist, finally came to the conclusion that if you don't have eyes, no human will give a damn about you, and grudgingly started giving attention to life forms blessed with that particular facial feature. He started with eels, then moved to sharks and finally sperm whales, which apparently have amazing eyes.
GRUBER: Ask anybody who's been eye-to-eye with a sperm whale. There is this transformative moment that this animal is looking at them seemingly deeper than they're looking at it - this really deep, sage intelligence behind this eye.
SPIEGEL: The charismatic megafauna had finally won David, so he started working on sperm whales. In fact, he got a whole batch of recordings of sperm whales. They sound like this.
(SOUNDBITE OF SPERM WHALES VOCALIZING)
SPIEGEL: One day, just by chance, he played that sound for a group of machine learning experts who told him to get more recordings because there was this new, truly remarkable thing that machine learning could do. So David reached out to Roger, king of the whale recordings, who it happened had recently heard from these two guys, Aza and Britt, who had a very similar idea and had even created a nonprofit called the Earth Species Project to work on it.
Eventually, they all got together and declared their mutual love and appreciation and made it official. David, Roger, Aza, Britt and about 15 other men and women, including whale researcher Shane Gero - all of these people have committed themselves. They're going to work together to translate sperm whale communication.
That is their stated purpose. But underneath, I see a different, even more fundamental ambition. What they're trying to do is find a way around the scale and tempo problem of climate change - make you feel in your soul the incredible horror standing in front of you and every other living being on this planet. That is their preposterous idea. The question is whether it can work.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: NPR's INVISIBILIA will return in a minute.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Whenever you write a story, particularly a story like this one, where what's being proposed is unconventional six different ways from Sunday, there's a lot of background reporting that typically doesn't make it into the final product. You're calling people in the subject area to test plausibility, feel out whether this thing that you're talking about seems completely insane or modestly insane, or maybe these people have some small glimmer of a point. Please, you say, lay out your very best critique as I record this phone call.
Which brings me to the background reporting that we did for this story.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Laughter) A lot to unpack there.
SPIEGEL: (Laughter) Yeah.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So we want to talk to the whales. Grand.
SPIEGEL: Producer Abby Wendle and I sat down and called all manner of highly respected professionals to ask a series of preposterous questions.
Do you think that, like, you could maybe take their sounds and translate them?
FRANS DE WAAL: Yeah.
JULIA ADENEY THOMAS: That's completely potty. Let me tell you why.
SPIEGEL: We started with animal experts like primatologist Frans de Waal, many of whom seemed uncertain that, first, animals actually had something that should be characterized as language, and second, if they did, that the things that they had to say would substantially alter our view of them.
DE WAAL: I want a banana or something like that.
SPIEGEL: Then there were the researchers who looked at environmental behavior change who we called because we wanted to know if, granting those other two conditions were met - animals have language and say more than pass the banana - would that actually change how people such as yourself behaved towards the environment, given the intense power of the scale and tempo problem? Again, this was met with what I would characterize as a healthy degree of skepticism, including by environmental and intellectual historian Julia Adeney Thomas.
ADENEY THOMAS: Strikes me as contrary to what we already know about our behavior.
SPIEGEL: We talked to scientists like geologists Marcia Bjornerud, who said the approach was misguided because changing individual attitudes and behavior, though useful, isn't enough.
MARCIA BJORNERUD: We need better policy.
SPIEGEL: To save ourselves, we need an extremely broad overhaul on the systems level.
BJORNERUD: We need a carbon tax. I mean, that's - to me, that's the first thing and the easiest we could implement.
SPIEGEL: It's the systems, stupid.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: And let's also talk for a second about this idea they have - when oppressed populations gain voice, it makes a difference. Many of our experts, like Julia Adeney Thomas, pointed out that humans themselves speak language, and that doesn't seem to soften our behavior towards them.
ADENEY THOMAS: We enslave people we can understand, right? We treat people terribly who speak the same language that we do.
SPIEGEL: And even if enough whale communication could be gathered to make a cloud - which, by the way, will require someone to invent and then build a fleet of aquatic audio recording robots - what are they going to do with the translated whale language? Are they going to use it to build a social network for whale human interspecies communication - a Witter-verse (ph)? And if so, will President Trump be allowed on it?
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: I know words. I have the best words.
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALES VOCALIZING)
SPIEGEL: Britt, Aza, David and Roger say they have no idea what tangible form this ultimately will take. They say it's too early in the project to guess. But you know what many people told us it was too late for? What they're trying to do. Here's Julia again.
ADENEY THOMAS: Is this the best use of our few resources?
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: We talked to linguists and machine learning experts and people involved in making robots that record sound. And though almost all of them thought that we would learn really important things from the very act of trying to accomplish this task of translating animal communication, like environmental policy analyst Anja Kollmuss, they didn't seem that optimistic that it would work when it came to the ultimate goal.
ANJA KOLLMUSS: It will do nothing to save us from this horrible future.
SPIEGEL: But here's the thing - given the intensity of the catastrophe that we face and the short time we have to deal with it, often, over the course of these conversations, a different tone emerged.
KOLLMUSS: There is something, kind of, that celebrates the human spirit. In that sense, I think it's lovely.
SPIEGEL: Many of the people we spoke to had been able, through sheer exposure and will, to erase for themselves the scale-tempo problem. Climate change no longer felt like something abstract and far away; it was looming before them, as real as the physical walls of the room they sat in. They had read the 2018 IPCC report which said, there could be an increase of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit in as little as 11 years. And to them, that was no longer a meaningless number. What that meant in terms of mass migrations and mass death and mass destabilization was very, very emotionally real.
KOLLMUSS: It's mind-bogglingly sad and terrifying. It really is, you know - it's easy to despair.
SPIEGEL: So even if this thing that we were talking about seemed like nine different shades of ridiculous, they were still open to it because they feel like we're in the 11th hour, which is the time to throw everything and the kitchen sink at the problem.
KOLLMUSS: We need everything.
SPIEGEL: Yeah.
KOLLMUSS: We need everything.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: So in sum, yes, there's plenty of reasons to feel skeptical about this project. But on the other hand, the desperation that is powering it seems completely and utterly rational. And a deep, real desperation is the thing that is propelling all of the people involved in this project.
PAYNE: I have, at the moment, not much hope.
SPIEGEL: Take Roger Payne. Even though he's committed himself to this Hail Mary pass, that's how he sees it - as a Hail Mary pass. He doesn't seem very optimistic.
Like really, truly not much hope?
PAYNE: Really, truly not much hope. I don't think we have much of a future. I suspect we may not have any and that we - it may end very quickly. That's my sad, true, deep feeling about what the future of humanity is.
SPIEGEL: How - what's your time frame?
PAYNE: One or two generations.
SPIEGEL: You have grandchildren.
PAYNE: Yep.
SPIEGEL: So what does that mean?
PAYNE: It means I - my heart breaks, really, about the thought of what kind of world their children will have.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Roger is one of the most influential environmentalists of our time, and he privately thinks we have one or two generations left. Honestly, it wasn't the time scale that I'd been thinking when I started this reporting. I hate that time scale. So I started calling around, looking for a second and third opinion. I wanted some level-headed climate scientist to tell me that Roger's prediction was insane. And eventually, I made it to Michael E. Mann from Penn State who, according to word on the street, is a great researcher but very nonapocalyptic. Unfortunately, Michael Mann wasn't as dismissive as I would have liked.
MICHAEL MANN: What he describes is correct in the eventuality that we fail to act on climate. But it's not correct if we choose to act, and I think there is the danger of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Our future has not yet been determined. And that is one possible future, but it does not have to be our actual future.
SPIEGEL: Basically, when Roger and Michael Mann look to the future, the real difference between them is their belief about humans. Roger does not believe we will make the kind of radical changes it will take; Michael Mann is more optimistic.
MANN: In American history, there have been a number of examples where we've sort of risen to a major challenge - the Apollo Project, you know, World War II mobilization. I think we are potentially sort of going through a tipping point right now.
SPIEGEL: It's comforting to know that we can change and that what we do does matter. Still, Roger's view haunted me throughout my reporting. And I got to say, I didn't get the sense that the others in the group - David, Britt, Aza - had a radically different take. Like, there was this moment between interviews when I was making small talk with Aza. Because I am an inappropriately nosy person, I was asking about his love life and whether he wanted to have kids. And the saddest look came into his eyes. He did want kids; it's just he couldn't see how he could do it given what he saw coming. So at the moment, it was an open question.
RASKIN: I think we are headed into an era of cascading climate collapse and cascading climate chaos. And the hardest to predict feedback loop is going to kick in, which is human behavior, and so we're going to see societal collapse. And that doesn't necessarily mean the end of the human race, but things are going to get really hard. We're going to have exponential suck.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: And then there's David Gruber.
GRUBER: Ah, the smell of home (laughter).
SPIEGEL: On my last day of reporting, I asked David to take me to the Passaic River so that we could sit on the bank of the Superfund site where he swam as a kid. Though the bank was green and lush, once you looked in the water, things got more grim. It didn't look like there was anything moving.
There has to be life, though, doesn't there?
GRUBER: There is. I mean, there - we will find it. It's just about going deep enough.
SPIEGEL: David, like the others, saw a terrifying darkness on the horizon. That's why, like the others, he'd committed himself to this strange Hail Mary. He sees that climate change is already devastating communities all over the world and is beginning to move so quickly that even our own naked human eyes can see it.
And the thing he wants to do about climate change, I realize later, has a lot to do with time and scale. He says he thinks it'll be hard to avoid the kind of cascading climate collapse Aza talked about. So the thing he's working to influence is the tempo of the demise. That's why in addition to doing this project, over the last five years, David has been changing his life and habits.
GRUBER: I've gotten rid of almost all my stuff. I live very minimalistically. I've stopped eating meat and fish. I try really not to fly as much as I possibly can. I try to take all my conferences on video conferences when I can.
SPIEGEL: Now, there's not one answer to climate change. So many things have to be done so quickly; so many systems need to be reformed. Still, David believes that if each of us made the personal choice to behave differently, started publicly demanding aggressive climate policies and programs despite the real financial consequences of pivoting away from fossil fuels, but also if all of us chose to live even a little bit smaller and a little bit slower - reduced car and plane use stopped eating as much meat - David and many others say those kinds of choices would add up until there was more time on our collective clock. We slow down; the crisis slows down.
GRUBER: If we all just look at ourselves and be like, is there little things that I can do? What is - what can I give? And it may not - it may be very little, and that's fine.
SPIEGEL: It's at least a beginning. And maybe the process of slowing down will help us see more clearly all the things that we need to do, all the ways we need to act. So let's practice right now - slowing down. Let's try to use a tempo that's more like the tempo you hear when you listen to the heartbeat of a whale. It's a hard thing to slow your tempo. A slower tempo feels strange and uncomfortable and sometimes even morally wrong. So much of the world is encouraging us to push faster, harder, farther. But here for a moment, let's try. Let's start with the heartbeat of a whale.
(SOUNDBITE OF HEART BEATING)
SPIEGEL: Like so much else about whales, its heartbeat feels the same but different from humans - slower, more grand.
(SOUNDBITE OF HEART BEATING)
SPIEGEL: I find this slowness beautiful. But also, slowness makes it hard to understand whales, even when they're directly in front of you. Take whale play - to the human eye, whale play does not in any way look like play. Play in the human mind is fast, a series of quick, light movements - baby foxes dancing on their mother's back, 5-year-olds streaking through a playground. To watch whales play is to see two animals calmly moving through a watery, blue space, almost immobile. It's only when you speed up the videotape that you can see - oh, they're playing; the baby whale is mimicking its mother.
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALES VOCALIZING)
SPIEGEL: Whales have massive communication networks - geographically, the largest besides humans. Researchers say blue whales pass their songs through deep water channels, information travelling across a great stretch of the planet, like an aquatic Internet.
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALES VOCALIZING)
SPIEGEL: What else could I tell you about whales? That their children babble like human children do, make noise at random until slowly their noise takes on the same structure as the adults in their population? Or that some researchers think that siren song, the idea of beautiful women who learned sailors to their death with strange music, that that myth stems from whales? Because during the time the Greeks, boats were made of wood, so if one happened to intersect with a whale song passing from one side of the ocean to another, the whole hull would vibrate with the noise, amplifying it like a kind of speaker.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SPIEGEL: Imagine sitting in the belly of a boat that's vibrating with the yawn of such a strange sound. Of course you would misinterpret it. Who would imagine that whales could sing?
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALES VOCALIZING)
SPIEGEL: Humans are constantly misinterpreting whales just as we fail to make sense of so many other things - because they're too slow or too fast or too big or too small or too strange. But maybe if we concentrate hard, we can shift, change what we think and what we do so the tempo of our own demise will slow down.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: That's Alix Spiegel.
In the spirit of shifting tempos, we have a favor to ask. We want you to take a minute and listen to the sounds around you and send us an audio recording. It could be anywhere, preferably a place that makes you happy - a beach, a city street, your backyard, wherever really. Take a recording - iPhone is fine - and send the MP3 with your name, the name of the place you recorded, to invisibiliamail@npr.org. That's invisibiliamail@npr.org. We're collecting the recording for a project, and maybe you'll hear yours in an upcoming episode. Now stay tuned for a preview of next week's INVISIBILIA.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: Next week on NPR's INVISIBILIA, we follow a summer program for teenagers where they're taught the opposite of what they learned in kindergarten - if you don't have anything nice to say, you should probably say it into the microphone so everyone can hear you...
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Stop taking positions just 'cause you're white. Stop taking positions just 'cause of the school that you go to
ROSIN: ...And where the counselors are not necessarily going to jump in and rescue you.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Have you ever thought, like, oh, God, I've gone too far, I was a little bit too offensive, I, like, hurt this person's feelings too much?
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Every day - every single day.
ROSIN: What you get and what you lose from directly confronting someone on the next INVISIBILIA.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: Invisibility is hosted by me, Hanna Rosin.
SPIEGEL: And me, Alix Spiegel. Our senior supervising editor is Deborah George. This episode was edited by Anne Gudenkauf.
(SOUNDBITE OF WHALES VOCALIZING)
SPIEGEL: INVISIBILIA is produced by Kia Miakka Natisse, Yowei Shaw and Abby Wendle. Our manager is Liana Simstrom.
ROSIN: We had help on this episode from Cara Tallo, Alec Stutson, Oliver Whang and David Guthertz. Fact-checking by Sarah Knight and Jamison Pfeifer. Our technical director is Andy Huether, and our senior vice president of programming is Anya Grundmann.
SPIEGEL: Special thanks to...
ROSIN: Jorge Reynolds for sharing his recordings of whale heartbeats with us.

** Is Climate Change Causing Sharks To Bite Humans? Metro Thinks So **

* https://www.npr.org/local/2020/03/12/814899037/is-climate-change-causing-sharks-to-bite-humans-metro-thinks-so *



      Jacob Fenston
    

 From

                Taking public transit reduces greenhouse gas emissions. But does it change shark behavior? Scientists are dubious.

Can taking Metro prevent shark bites? That's the contention of an ad in stations and trains throughout the region. It's part of a Metro public relations campaign to highlight the effects of climate change and how taking public transit can help. If you've seen the shark bite ads and wondered about them — you're in good company.
""As someone who studies sharks and shark conservation, and in fact who has been involved in studies of climate change and sharks, this caught my attention,"" says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist. The ad caught his attention, he says, ""because it's nonsense.""
The ad shows a black shark fin on an orange zig-zag background. It reads: ""More CO2 could lead to increased shark bites. Keep the sharks at bay. Take Metro.""

                Arctic ice is melting, due to human-caused carbon emissions.

Metro's other climate change ads are on pretty solid scientific ground. There's one about arctic ice melting and one about extreme weather — both well known consequences of climate change. Other ads focus on more obscure impacts — how climate change is affecting wine and beer producers. Still, says Shiffman, ""The agricultural consequences are fairly well documented and not controversial.""

                The agricultural impacts of climate change are well documented.

But he kept seeing the shark bite ad on his daily Metro commute and became preoccupied by whether or not there is a connection. Finally he thought, ""Maybe I'm crazy and maybe there is a causal link somewhere that I've never heard of.""
So Shiffman decided to investigate.
He reached out to about a dozen of what he says are the world's leading experts on how climate change affects marine animals.
""One person told me that I made them spit out their coffee, one person said, 'If I'm being charitable, it's imaginative.'""
Shiffman wrote up his investigation for his blog, Southern Fried Science. He runs through all the possible explanations for how climate change could cause more shark bites, many suggested by his social media followers. Here are a few, which Shiffman says he put in order of most to least ridiculous:
Most absurd: Climate change is causing sea level rise, bringing sharks into our cities and towns.
""No! That's not how sea level rise works,"" says Shiffman. ""Sea level rise is a major problem. It may, in the next few decades, lead to us having to abandon coastal cities.""
But that doesn't mean we will be walking around in neck-deep water, fending off sharks. ""Before we get to that point, people are going to have to move,"" says Shiffman.
Still extremely absurd: Sharks will bite us because they can no longer tell the difference between us and their normal prey.
Climate change is causing the oceans' chemistry to change, becoming more acidic, with higher levels of CO2 and less oxygen. Those changes do affect shark behavior and can impact their sense of smell.
""It can make it harder for predators to smell prey, it can make it harder for prey to smell predators,"" says Shiffman. ""But that doesn't mean suddenly we smell like food, it just means it's harder for them to find food.""
Most shark bites occur because sharks mistake humans for their usual prey: marine mammals. Humans are not on the menu, and after most bites, sharks do not return for more. ""Sharks don't eat humans and changing environmental conditions aren't going to change that,"" Shiffman writes.
Kinda absurd: Shark habitat ranges are shifting, bringing them closer to humans, thus increasing the chance of shark bites.
This slightly more plausible explanation appears to be loosely based on scientific evidence. But on further inspection, it falls apart.
Chuck Bangley, a researcher at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and one of the experts Shiffman consulted, studied sharks along the coast of North Carolina. He found there was a big increase in the number of bull sharks in 2011 and 2012. When he looked at what environmental factors might be involved, ""The water temperature lit right up as being associated with this increase in shark numbers,"" says Bangley.
So this seems like solid evidence: warmer water equals more sharks, so probably more shark bites, right?
Wrong. For one thing, the sharks were mostly juveniles. ""Some all the way down to the size that they're born,"" says Bangley. (Baby sharks! Probably not biting anyone.)
There's also this inconvenient fact: ""An increase in shark activity in one area might actually point to a decrease in shark activity somewhere else,"" says Bangley.
Moreover, Bangley says, a few more sharks in one place isn't what's scary about his research. Rather it's the big picture — how climate change is already wreaking havoc on ecosystems. Sharks are shifting north, and so are many other creatures, from clams to lobsters.
""Sharks are typically the apex predators in marine ecosystems, so if they're shifting, it means a lot of the rest of the ecosystem has either already shifted or is in the process of shifting with them,"" Bangley says. ""It's already disrupting local economies — tourism, fisheries.""

                A shark researcher needs a good shark tie, for special occasions.

In the end, David Shiffman came up with two plausible explanations for Metro's shark bite ad — neither of them very satisfying.
First: Warmer weather means more people heading to the beach, leading to a higher chance of shark bites.
Still, he says, getting bitten by a shark is ""astronomically unlikely."" For example, far more people die from selfie accidents each year than from shark bites. Also, it's kind of unfair to blame sharks for a change caused by human behavior.
The most likely explanation (and the least satisfying), according to Shiffman: The ad is just flat wrong. ""One of my good friends was just baffled by how obsessed I became with this ad, and said, quite simply and correctly, 'Metro ads are not peer reviewed.'""
Indeed, Metro seems to concur with this explanation. When I asked for an interview about the ad, a spokesperson wrote in an email, ""This is about choosing Metro as a sustainable transportation mode, something that is not in dispute."" He went on to write, ""It's an ad, not a white paper.""
The climate change ad campaign has generally been well-received by environmentalists.
""Metro's ads serve a specific goal — it's to get people thinking about the consequences of their actions and the tie-in between mass transportation and climate change,"" says Aykut Yilmaz, with the D.C. chapter of the Sierra Club.
But, he says, the biggest thing Metro can do to help the climate is providing the best, most reliable service. He says the transit agency is heading in the right direction, with the latest budget proposals. ""They're bringing back late-night service, thinking about reducing costs for using it on the weekends.""
And taking Metro is better for the environment, In 2018, the Metro system reduced the region's greenhouse gas emissions, compared to a theoretical Metro-less Washington, by 370,000 metric tons of CO2 — equal to the emissions from using 41 million gallons of gasoline.
Metro riders are helping to slow arctic ice melt and prevent stronger hurricanes. But no, taking Metro won't keep the sharks at bay.
So why was Shiffman so obsessed with this one ad about sharks? Sharks loom large in our popular imagination, and Shiffman says they are frequently misrepresented, and subject to fearmongering. The Metro ad is seen by thousands of people each day — a captive audience in trains and on platforms.
""People's opinions about the world are sometimes shaped by subway ads,"" says Shiffman. ""It matters. It perhaps doesn't matter all that much, but it matters.""
He wanted to not only satisfy his own curiosity (no, he's not crazy), but also set the record straight about the link between shark bites and climate change.
""Sharks are some of the most threatened animals in the world, they're some of the most ecologically important animals in the world, and they're some of the most misunderstood animals in the world.""

** How The Supreme Court Made 'Climate History' In Massachusetts V ... **

<iframe width=""100%"" height=""124"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""no"" src=""https://player.wbur.org/hereandnow/2020/03/09/rule-of-five-climate-lawsuit-epa-book""></iframe>
One Supreme Court decision sparked some of the most significant actions taken by the U.S. government to deal with climate change.
Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection Agency was decided in a 5 to 4 ruling in 2007. It laid the groundwork for many of former President Obama’s climate policies, including the Clean Power Plan.
It all began in 1999 when a man named Joe Mendelson, an environmental lawyer who worked for a small public interest group, delivered a petition to the EPA urging them to regulate carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act, says Richard Lazarus, author of a new book about the case called, ""The Rule of Five: Making Climate History at the Supreme Court.""
“He thought it was obvious. He thought the science was clear,” says Lazarus, who teaches at Harvard Law School and has represented the government and environmental groups in 40 Supreme Court cases.
Mendelson had been making noise about this issue for a while and faced criticism for it, even from mainstream environmental groups who told him to “quiet down” and “don’t rock the boat,” Lazarus says.
“And Joe finally got fed up. He walked down to EPA, handed them a petition, which said, 'I think you've got an obligation to regulate greenhouse gases,' ” Lazarus says. “And it was such a controversial move when he pushed that on EPA that even some of the other environmental groups managed to lobby to cut off his funding.”
In 2003, the EPA determined that it didn’t have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide or other pollutants for climate change purposes.
Many mainstream environmentalists understood that making a change like the one Mendelson proposed was all about timing, Lazarus says. And historically, the Supreme Court did not hear cases that environmentalists lost in the lower courts.
“In the past, the court has often just never seen it to be important or the time is right when the environmentalists have lost in the lower court,” he says. “They've been pretty ready to grant cases when the government has lost or industry has lost. And that's what made this [case] so unusual.”
Environmental lawyers cleverly pitched the case to the court as an administrative law case rather than an environmental one, Lazarus says. Basically, they ditched the question of whether or not greenhouse gases are air pollutants, and instead, they asked the court to consider if the EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases.
“And then in sort of what is known as classic bait-and-switch strategy before the Supreme Court, once the court granted review, they then buried the issue they said was so important, and they put front and center the big question they cared about and that's whether greenhouse gases are air pollutants are not,” Lazarus says.
In the case, the person everyone was watching was Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was the swing vote in many instances.
“Justice Kennedy ... was the decisive vote in basically every single environmental case in over three decades except one,” Lazarus says. “Everyone knew this case would be no exception.”
Everyone knew this, including Justice John Paul Stevens. But Stevens also knew that he had to write the opinion in a way that kept Kennedy on the majority’s side.
“What Justice Stevens told me was this was a really important case to him,” Lazarus says. “He could not understand why so many people, including so many Republicans, and he was a Republican, didn't understand the seriousness of climate change. He wanted to make a statement.”
Massachusetts vs. EPA is called “the most significant environmental decision ever” by the Supreme Court, Lazarus says. And that’s because it laid the groundwork for so many environmental policies going forward, including Obama’s Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement.
But the Trump administration has quickly unraveled many of these policies, which is why he says the 2020 election may determine the fate of climate issues.
“If the Trump administration is confined to four years, basically every single thing that happened during the Obama administration can be protected,” Lazarus says. “If there's another four years, it will be much harder, protect all those regulations, all those rules, and harder to protect the Paris Agreement.”

The public action marks the beginning of a wave of protests, dubbed the 'International Rebellion', that is expected to spread across 60 cities worldwide, including New York, Berlin and Madrid among others.
Climate change campaigners from the 'Extinction Rebellion' movement are taking to the streets in London on Monday, 7 October, to protest what they call the inertia of the governments around the globe in the face of a climate and ecological crisis.
The XR is looking to continue their civil disobedience for 14 days unless the government meets their demands. They also intend to block all the roads in central London.
Movements allied to 'Extinction Rebellion' have also joined Monday's demonstrations.
The group is a climate advocacy organisation whose aim is to urge the governments around the globe to drastically revamp climate change policies to avoid climate breakdown, biodiversity loss, the risk of human extinction and ecological collapse. Their long-term objective is the complete elimination of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025.

An effigy was hung from a bridge to mock the method of the climate protesters. The mayor of Rome noted that all of the Eternal City is in support of the teenage activist.
Virginia Raggi, the mayor of Rome, on Monday condemned the “shameful” effigy depicting the eccentric teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg which had been hung from a bridge near the city airport.
“My solidarity and solidarity of all @Rome goes to [Greta Thunberg] and her family,” Raggi tweeted, speaking for the entire city. “Our climate commitment does not stop.”
According to WSET radio station, the effigy had a wig of hair in pigtails similar to Thunberg’s and a sign reading: “Greta is Your God!”
Vergognoso il manichino di @GretaThunberg ritrovato appeso a un ponte nella nostra città. A lei e alla sua famiglia la mia solidarietà e quella di tutta @Roma. Il nostro impegno sul clima non si ferma. pic.twitter.com/YXMXMJDA3D
​Local emergency services were tasked with removing the effigy, according to WSET.
On Monday, a climate change protester “hanged” himself from Story Bridge in Brisbane, Australia, demanding that the Queensland premier declare a national climate emergency.
While the move caused a brief interruption in traffic, a negotiator is now attempting to talk the protester into leaving his suspended hammock, Australia’s 7News report says.
Thunberg rose to prominence after delivering a strikingly aggressive speech before world leaders at the  annual UN General Assembly in New York. Thunberg has become the most prominent global icon for addressing climate change.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Activists of international climate movement Extinction Rebellion blocked roads in the centre of Amsterdam on Monday morning as part of the global campaign to raise awareness about what they describe as a climate catastrophe.
At photos posted by Extinction Rebellion on social media, hundreds of protesters are seen demanding stronger measures to fight climate change in front of the Rijksmuseum.
""Tell the truth! Wees eerlijk [Be Honest in English]! Blockade #ExtinctionRebellion in Amsterdam is a fact! We are here to stay to #RebelForLife,"" the movement tweeted.

The graffiti artwork was repeatedly painted over during the weekend, as Alberta residents say the climate activist does not offer working solutions in her climate speeches.
A Canadian mural depicting Greta Thunberg was defaced repeatedly over the weekend by those protesting the anti-fossil fuel narrative promoted by the teenage climate activist.
Initially, the mural was spray-painted over with a protest message on Friday.
A CBC journalist, who claimed to have just happened to be at the scene at the time of the incident interviewed the protester, who disclosed that his late father was an oil worker and that he would be “disgusted” to see the mural depicting Thunberg.
The spray painter, who identified himself as James Bagnell, suggested that Thunberg should begin with her home country before embarking on a world tour.
New Greta Thunberg mural in Edmonton, Canada painted Friday for her visit, defaced by Saturday & obliterated by Sunday. Artist: ""Nothing lasts forever. One of my favourite things a/b that wall is that anyone is allowed 2 express themselves there, so I'm not upset @ all"" pic.twitter.com/Yt1C8skWqD
​Later that weekend, another person again spray-painted the mural, blackening out Thunberg’s eyes.
On Friday, Thunberg gave a speech in Alberta, which was met with counter-protests, as people blamed the climate activist for not proposing real-world solutions.
Bagnell stated that Thunberg should offer solutions or “shut up,” according to the report.
The artist behind the original mural, AJA Louden, said he was not upset because of the spray-painting action, saying the artwork was made on a “free wall,” and anyone can paint whatever they want. 
He suggested that people who are “upset” by the painting being damaged should “paint back over it.”
Greta Thunberg initially came into the spotlight after her standing protest on the steps of the Swedish parliament in Stockholm in 2018. This year, she became a world famous after delivering a strikingly aggressive speech on climate change before world leaders at the UN General Assembly.

Last month was the warmest September on record, “virtually on a par with September 2016,” according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is part of the European Union’s Earth Observation Programme.

A report released Friday by Copernicus found that September was 0.57 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 average. In addition, the temperatures across most of Europe were above average, particularly in the south and south-east of the continent. 
Much of Norway and Sweden experienced below-average temperatures. Meanwhile, temperatures over most of the US, parts of the Arctic and Iran, Afghanistan, Mongolia, northern China, central South America, South Africa, south-western Australia and West Antarctica were all above the 1981-2010 average. 
“Temperatures over land were notably below average only over south-western Russia, the Central Asian Republics and parts of Antarctica, although several other regions experienced temperatures that were slightly below average for the month,” the report adds.
And September was not an anomaly.
June and July this year were the warmest ever in recorded history, while 2019’s August was the second-hottest August ever recorded. 
Copernicus Climate Change Service Director Jean-Noel Thepaut painted a bleak picture of the future, as greenhouse gas emissions continue to plague the environment.
""The recent series of record-breaking temperatures is an alarming reminder of the long-term warming trend that can be observed on a global level,"" Thepaut said in a statement to AFP.
""With continued greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting impact on global temperatures, records will continue to be broken in the future,"" he added. 
A September report by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) revealed that the Northern Hemisphere experienced its hottest summer on record between June and August this year. The report also noted that the global average sea surface temperature in August was 1.51 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the “20th-century monthly average of 61.4 degrees Fahrenheit,” marking the highest sea surface temperature ever recorded in the month of August. Arctic sea ice coverage in August was also found to be 30.1% lower than average.

** Turning From Meat Consumption to Veganism Cannot Solve ... **

United Nations experts have recently argued that the high consumption of meat and dairy products is fuelling global warming. However, the assumption that going vegan could potentially help reduce environmental problems is not shared by all experts in the field.  
Researchers from the University of Edinburgh and Scotland’s Rural College said that a reduction in the consumption of meat would not necessarily help the environment, while pointing at the importance of livestock production, The Telegraph reports.
Speaking at a recent panel on the future of meat production, the UK’s leading experts on animal and agricultural food science, including University of Edinburgh Professor Geoff Simm and Scotland’s Rural College Professor Mike Coffey, said that the livestock sector has recently been intensively demonised, despite being crucial for global development. They also point out that recent studies have not proved that shifting to a vegan or vegetarian diet would help tackle environmental issues globally.
“Meat has massive social benefits”, the expert added. “It’s an important source of dietary protein, energy, highly bioavailable micronutrients, even small amounts of animal-sourced food have a really important effect on the development of children, in the developing world on their cognitive and physical development and they are really important”.
Recent research prepared by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated that increased reliance on meat and dairy products tend to contribute to global warming through ineffective use of land, calling for a reduction in meat consumption. These findings are not supported by the UK experts, though, with Professor Mike Coffey insisting that veganism is not an answer to tackling climate change.
In the meantime, new breeds of eco-friendly cattle are expected to soon emerge in the UK livestock sector and potentially in the world. These selected breeds will potentially grow faster and consume less food, thus reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere.

Dozens of people stormed the field during the halftime break at Saturday's annual football game between Harvard and Yale. Police first engaged in negotiations with the protesters, but later arrested the climate activists who reportedly indicated to law enforcement that they ""want to be arrested.""
On Saturday, students said to be from both Harvard and Yale universities staged a sit-in protest during the halftime break in the football game between the two high-profile schools, demanding that the two educational institutions change their investment strategy.

The protesters reportedly stormed the field just before the start of the third quarter, filling the midfield area and disrupting the game for some 40 minutes.
Harvard and Yale activists are demanding that the administrations of their universities stop ""investing in injustice,"" and divest their school endowments from fossil-fuel profits.

The sit-in ended after negotiations between the police and students resulted in arrests reportedly conducted following the expression of a desire by the activists to be arrested.
Harvard-Yale update: The protestors have told police they want to be arrested. So police have tied them together, two at a time, and are taking them off the field. Kickoff in about 10-mins.
Following the disrupted game, a Yale statement noted that although the university ""stands for the right to free expression"", the school regretted the students' choice of time and place for their action.
Yale has also expressed its gratitute to ""the staff members and police officers who ensured the peaceful departure of students from the field"", noting that ""The exercise of free expression on campus is subject to general conditions, and we do not allow disruption of university events.""
The sit-in, however, was praised by many climate activists in the Internet, with some politicians, particularly in the Democratic party, highlighting the significance of widespread climate activism. Among the latter were Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and US presidential hopefuls Julian Castro and Bernie Sanders.
Activism disrupts the present to change the future. 🌎 https://t.co/K4OLyeATMu
From the March for Our Lives, to worldwide Climate Strikes, students and young people are leading the charge to protect their futures. I’m inspired by their efforts to hold their universities to a higher standard. https://t.co/tbskzCRvSa

Boris Johnson was criticized by party leaders and represented by a dripping ice sculpture after refusing to appear in a televised election debate focusing on climate change.
Johnson's UK Conservative Party complained to the UK's broadcasting watchdog Ofcom ahead of the Channel 4 event, which saw Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson and the heads of the UK's other main parties debating on their plans to tackle the climate crisis ahead of next month's poll.
The party said its offer of having minister Michael Gove stand in for Johnson was rejected by Channel 4, complaining that the decision ""effectively seeks to deprive the Conservative Party of any representation and attendance at the Channel 4 News debate.""
These are the introductory #ClimateDebate statements from the leaders of Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens.Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage did not accept our invitation to attend. pic.twitter.com/NTHrDTK9hW
​
The program’s editor replied that Johnson ""sent his two wing men"" - Gove and Johnson's father, Stanley - to attempt to ""argue their way into"" a program intended only for leaders.
Johnson and Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party who also decided not to attend the debate, were replaced with ice sculptures bearing their parties' logos, which Channel 4 said was intended to ""represent the emergency on planet earth.""
The event took place on the same day that scientists warned the Earth is heading to a ""tipping point,"" and hours after the European Parliament voted to declare a climate emergency. The UK became the first country to make such a declaration in May, after Corbyn's Labour Party led a successful push in the Parliament.
The UK Prime Minister, who is now campaigning for the UK General Elections, was earlier criticized by opposition both within his own party and from other parties when on Tuesday he refused to take part in an interview with BBC presenter Andrew Neil, which all of the other major leaders have done.

​The former Top Gear host previously slammed the green movement as “eco-mentalists”, and in 2009 environmental campaigners dumped manure on the lawn of Clarkson’s £2 million Cotswolds home in response to his attitude to global warming.
Controversial British TV star Jeremy Clarkson has caused widespread shock after publicly accepting the existence of global warming, having been an ardent and voluble denier for many years.
Clarkson’s damascene conversion followed he and his Grand Tour co-hosts ran into difficulty while filming a 500-mile boat race from Siem Reap, Cambodia to Vung Tau, Vietnam.
The group’s jet boats slowed to a crawl and the trio were forced to wade through Tonle Sap lake in the usually deep Mekong river system, due to water shortages.
— Chris Doyle (@Doylech) November 24, 2019
​Speaking to the Sunday Times, Clarkson said the “irony” wasn’t lost on him – “a man who hosted a car programme for 30 years, limited to seven miles per hour by global warming.”
However, Clarkson’s transformation doesn’t seem total – he also attacked Greta Thurnberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate campaigner who has garnered so much media attention.
Clarkson has attacked Thurnberg in his Sun newspaper column, calling her “spoilt brat”, following her speech at the United Nation’s climate action summit in September, in which she accused world leaders of stealing her “dreams and childhood” with “empty words”.

Swedish eco-warrior Greta Thunberg crossed the Atlantic in the summer to speak to world leaders ahead of the UN General Assembly meeting. She had expected to stay in the Americas for another month to attend another important climate change summit in Chile, but there has been a sudden change of schedule.
Greta Thunberg is never in a flying mood, but recent developments in Chile might force her to reconsider her attitude to aircraft.
The 16-year-old activist – whose climate expertise remains a source of debate – made a 15-day voyage across the Atlantic this August. She has since addressed world leaders at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York and joined climate strikes in Canada, and is currently rallying young people in wildfire-hit California against the “failing older generations” of decision-makers.
Greta’s initial plan was to visit South and Central America and wrap up her journey to the New World with an address to the UN COP25 climate conference, slated for early December. However, mass anti-government protests prompted Santiago to pull out as host this week. The event – billed as the world’s most important conference on climate change – has been relocated to Spain.
The news has seemingly caught Greta off-guard. “As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I’ll need some help,” she tweeted on Friday. “It turns out I’ve traveled half around the world, the wrong way. Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November... If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.”

Greta now has precisely 30 days to make it to Madrid, where the summit kicks off on 2 December. The task is all the more pressing because the team that accompanied her on the way to New York on board a zero-emission sailboat has already returned to Europe and is currently taking part in a trans-Atlantic yachting race.
Fellow sailor Pierre Casiraghi told the New York Times in a July interview that there are “only a handful” of zero-emissions vessels like the one that ferried Greta, which means that she will have to choose from a limited number of options.
And as if that wasn’t difficult enough of a task, it will take her at least three days to return to the US east coast by train from California.
She added: “I’m so sorry I’ll not be able to visit South and Central America this time, I was so looking forward to this. But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel.”
I’m so sorry I’ll not be able to visit South and Central America this time, I was so looking forward to this. But this is of course not about me, my experiences or where I wish to travel. We’re in a climate and ecological emergency. I send my support to the people in Chile.

A new study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that Indonesia’s glaciers on a mountain range in the country’s Papua region are expected to melt and disappear within a decade.

“The glaciers near Puncak Jaya, Papua, Indonesia, the last tropical glaciers in the Western Pacific Warm Pool, have recently undergone a rapid pace of loss of ice cover and a 5.4-fold increase in the rate of thinning,” the report explains.
“They are the ‘canaries in the coal mine,’” she noted.
Donaldi Permana, another author on the study, noted how the melting of tropical glaciers is a direct reflection of rising temperatures due to global warming.
“Tropical glaciers are mostly smaller, and so their response time to variations in climate change is faster compared to larger glaciers and ice sheets,” Permana explained. In fact, Papua’s glaciers are believed to have diminished by around 85% during the last few decades, AFP reported.
According to the researchers, the melting of Indonesia’s glaciers have been accelerated by the El Niño phenomenon. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration refers to the phenomenon as “large-scale ocean-atmosphere climate interaction linked to a periodic warming in sea surface temperatures across the central and east-central Equatorial Pacific.”
The glaciers have cultural and sacred significance to some indigenous Papuans. 
Glacier loss is becoming a more frequent occurrence around the world as global temperatures continue to increase.
In August, people gathered in Borgarfjörður, Iceland, a fjord in the west of the island nation near the town of Borgarnes, to mourn the loss of Okjokull, an Icelandic ice mass no longer thick enough to be considered a glacier. The glacier was officially declared dead by glaciologist Oddur Sigurðsson in 2014, when he noticed that its snow and ice were melting faster than the accumulation rate.

Greta Thunberg’s speech at the UN climate summit drew mixed feelings with the 16 year-old being praised for her bold statements by supporters and environmentalists and criticised by officials and presidents. 
British DJ and musician Fatboy Slim has confessed he “nearly burst into tears” when he played a remix of his old hit ""Right Here, Right Now"", featuring excerpts of Greta Thunberg’s speech at the United Nations. In an interview with the newspaper WAtoday, the artist said climate change is something that he passionately believes in.
""It was just so powerful and emotive that someone had linked a record I’d done 20 years ago to something now, and something I passionately believe in"", said Fatboy Slim, also known as Norman Cook. ""I like that it kind of sticks it to people who don’t believe in climate change, or find Greta Thunberg annoying, it’s quite a defiant move for me as well. If you stick around long enough things come around again, and a whole new meaning has come into Right Here, Right Now"".

​Climate activist Greta Thunberg used the call action “right here, right now” in her speech at the UN climate summit this year. The 16-year-old accused world leaders of robbing her of her childhood, apparently referring to her decision to quit school and start campaigning for climate action. Addressing the audience at the summit Thunberg said:
""People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?""
Her passionate speech was praised by supporters, but world leaders were less enthusiastic about it. In particular, French President Emmanuel Macron criticised the young activist for her radical position, while Russian President Vladimir Putin called Thunberg a kind and sincere girl, but stressed that she does not understand the intricacies of the world.

While in Madrid, on her way back from the US where she had campaigned and made fiery speeches over these past three months, eco-activist Greta Thunberg called for more activists to join their ranks citing the lack of productivity of today’s rallies.
The global wave of school strikes for the climate over the past year has “achieved nothing” as greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, Greta Thunberg has told activists at UN climate talks in Madrid.
“Some people are afraid to change – they try so desperately to silence us"".
Over the past four years, since the landmark Paris Accord on climate change and carbon footprints was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen by at least 4%, according to statistics outlined in the Global Carbon Project.
Speaking at a press conference before the scheduled march was to sweep across downtown Madrid, Thunberg lamented that international schoolchildren’s campaigning inspired by her solo protest in Sweden in 2017, “has not translated into action” by governments.
Thunberg said she had been pinning her hopes on the UN negotiations, expressing doubt if governments around the world had grasped the idea behind her and her team’s protests and warning that inaction could be damaging.
Heartily welcoming climate crisis awareness, Thunberg contended:
“We can’t go on like this; it is not sustainable that children skip school and we don’t want to continue – we would love some action from the people in power. People are suffering and dying today. We can’t wait any longer"", she said.
Swedish teen eco-activist Greta Thunberg is among the four recipients of this year's Right Livelihood Award, also known as the ""alternative Nobel Prize"" for human rights.
The teen has become the face of a youth environmental action inspired by her skipping classes every Friday to protest in front of the Swedish parliament building for more effective environmental legislation.
Thunberg now in Madrid, having toured North America for nearly three months, led climate strikes as well as spoke at a United Nations climate action summit. She travelled there on a low carbon footprint boat, which she also used for a return trip, having to skip the ""alternative Nobel Prize""  ceremony.

** Turning From Meat Consumption to Veganism Cannot Solve ... **

United Nations experts have recently argued that the high consumption of meat and dairy products is fuelling global warming. However, the assumption that going vegan could potentially help reduce environmental problems is not shared by all experts in the field.  
Researchers from the University of Edinburgh and Scotland’s Rural College said that a reduction in the consumption of meat would not necessarily help the environment, while pointing at the importance of livestock production, The Telegraph reports.
Speaking at a recent panel on the future of meat production, the UK’s leading experts on animal and agricultural food science, including University of Edinburgh Professor Geoff Simm and Scotland’s Rural College Professor Mike Coffey, said that the livestock sector has recently been intensively demonised, despite being crucial for global development. They also point out that recent studies have not proved that shifting to a vegan or vegetarian diet would help tackle environmental issues globally.
“Meat has massive social benefits”, the expert added. “It’s an important source of dietary protein, energy, highly bioavailable micronutrients, even small amounts of animal-sourced food have a really important effect on the development of children, in the developing world on their cognitive and physical development and they are really important”.
Recent research prepared by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated that increased reliance on meat and dairy products tend to contribute to global warming through ineffective use of land, calling for a reduction in meat consumption. These findings are not supported by the UK experts, though, with Professor Mike Coffey insisting that veganism is not an answer to tackling climate change.
In the meantime, new breeds of eco-friendly cattle are expected to soon emerge in the UK livestock sector and potentially in the world. These selected breeds will potentially grow faster and consume less food, thus reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere.

The 16-year-old eco-warrior has managed to galvanise many contemporaries but faced criticism from some high-profile politicians after she accused them of not doing enough to tackle climate change.
Greta Thunberg has continued her beef with Donald Trump, saying she wouldn’t speak to him if given an opportunity.
“So I probably wouldn’t have said anything, I wouldn't have wasted my time"".
Donald Trump, an established climate change skeptic who has pulled out of the 2015 Paris Agreement and relaxed or rolled back dozens of Obama-era environmental rules, has attacked Thunberg more than once in the past few months.
Earlier in December, for instance, he suggested that she “work on her anger management problem”, while in September he mocked her impassioned speech at a UN climate change summit in New York.
Greta Thunberg, with her dire predictions about the environment and her aggressive campaigning for more action on climate change, has divided opinions worldwide. While thousands of young people across the globe heeded her call and joined Friday school strikes, some politicians have been skeptical about her agenda.
Brazil’s President Bolsonaro, another outspoken climate change skeptic, has referred to Thunberg as a “brat” and complained she receives too much press, while Australian Prime Minister Morrison shot back that he was “not here to impress people overseas” after the girl called on his government to take more action on environmental protection.
“Those attacks are just funny because they obviously don't mean anything"", Thunberg told the BBC. “I guess of course it means something – they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don't want – but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat"".
Her father, Svante Thunberg, who also took part in the broadcast, recounted how Greta was fighting with mental issues prior to leading her youth climate strikes.
He said that he felt it was “a bad idea” for Greta to engage in campaigning, but said that she handles the criticism “incredibly well”.

Phoenix and Martin Sheen were attending Jane Fonda's weekly climate change protest, which has been held since October, along with other celebrities, including  Susan Sarandon, Amber Valletta, and June Diane Raphael.
Actors Joaquin Phoenix and Martin Sheen have been arrested at Jane Fonda's weekly environmental protest on Capitol Hill, NBC News reported on Friday.
According to the outlet, the Hollywood climate activists failed to follow a police order to disperse.

During his speech at Capitol Hill, Phoenix called on the public to opt out of meat and milk products due to their ""harm to the environment"". The actor, however, sadly confessed that he could not avoid travelling by plane.
Doubts are often cast on the sincerity of celebrity pledges to combat climate change, as some question their environmental footprint given their wealth and lifestyle.
The ""climate emergency"" itself is a very disputable matter, since a lot of scientists doubt that reducing carbon dioxide emissions, in accordance with the Paris Agreement, would actually prevent the world from becoming warmer.

As the third day of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum kicked off in the Swiss resort village of Davos, more than 3,000 high-ranking officials are about to discuss a range of topics, prioritizing economic, geopolitical and environmental challenges.
The third day of the Davos forum will include special addresses from a number of high-profile speakers, including Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Giuseppe Conte, Prime Minister of Italy, and Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece, will also be holding a separate Q and A event, and Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic of Ghana, will be holding a press conference.
Another address will be delivered by Juan Guaidó, who came to Davos despite the travel ban imposed by President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro. Guaidó had illegally declared himself interim president of Venezuela almost a year ago, sparking a political crisis in the country.
The United States, followed by several European and Latin American countries, has supported Guaido while other countries including Russia, China, Cuba, and Turkey, have insisted that Maduro is the only legitimate president of Venezuela. 
Another key topic to be discussed will be Brexit: risks of an economic recession, navigating Brexit, trade uncertainty and reforming economic policy measures will be among the topics discussed by European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni, Italian Minister of Economy and Finance Roberto Gualtieri, DHL Group CEO Frank Appel and Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing.

The NATO meeting will feature NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, President of Poland Andrzej Duda and Italy’s Minister for European Affairs Vincenzo Amendola.
Several meetings will be dedicated to the fourth industrial revolution and the use of technology in the modern age: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is going to hold a conversation on unlocking inclusive economic growth and equitable globalization through technological progress, while Maxim Oreshkin, who was recently replaced as Minister for Economic Development during the shift of the Russian government on January 15, will be among speakers during the “Russian National AI Strategy and the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.” Oreshkin will also be the key speaker during a talk on the global impact of EU-Russia relations.
And last, but not least, climate change resumes being among the most discussed topics. A carbon-neutral future, climate risks, effective management of ocean protection and environmentally friendly tourism will be among the priorities discussed by the world leaders.
The talk entitled “The Disposable Society,” addressing how businesses, industries and civil society can reorient economic incentives to shift to a circular economy and generate less garbage will conclude the third day of the World Economic Forum.

Scientists have linked climate change to global daily weather patterns for the first time in a new study published Thursday in the journal Nature Climate Change. 

According to the study, climate scientists have generally touted that “weather is not climate” and that climate change is instead the “change in the distribution of weather” over decades. 
The researchers also found that global temperatures and humidity are affected by human factors and not just random variability, and that long-term climate change trends can be predicted from global average temperatures.
“Global mean temperature on a single day is already quite a bit shifted. You can see this human fingerprint in any single moment,” he added, also noting,  “Weather is climate change if you look over the whole globe.”
“This . . . is telling us that anthropogenic climate change has become so large that it exceeds even daily weather variability at the global scale,” Wehner told the Washington Post. “This is disturbing as the Earth is on track for significantly more warming in even the most optimistic future scenarios.”

American music artist Meat Loaf gave an interview on 1 January where he shared his personal stance on climate change, claiming Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg had been “brainwashed”.
Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has given a Twitter response to rock icon Meat Loaf's statement that she has been ""brainwashed"" on climate change, writing on Monday that the environmental issue extends well beyond the two of them.
""It’s not about what some people call me. It’s not about left or right. It’s all about scientific facts. And that we’re not aware of the situation. Unless we start to focus everything on this, our targets will soon be out of reach,"" Thunberg tweeted, adding a Carbon Brief fact-checking spreadsheet.
It’s not about Meatloaf.It’s not about me.It’s not about what some people call me.It’s not about left or right.It’s all about scientific facts.And that we’re not aware of the situation.Unless we start to focus everything on this, our targets will soon be out of reach. https://t.co/UwyoSnLiK2
​Earlier, Meat Loaf, 72, told the Daily Mail in an interview on 1 January that he does not believe in climate change, but rather, that he believes Thunberg, 17, has been ""brainwashed.""
Some netizens sprang to the climate activist’s defence.
I kind of understand why @GretaThunberg keeps being the target of so much online bullying... she's speaking the truth
She is seen by fossil fuel billionaires as a threat to their self-enrichment, and they react by bankrolling attacks on climate science and activists like Greta.
She is a very brave young woman taking in the establishment! Big government deniers! Greta is a positive role model for us all! 🇨🇦
​Others on social media quoted Greta Thunberg’s own words back at her, stating that, indeed, it was all about “scientific facts”.
You are correct. It *is* all about scientific facts.Here are three very important ones:1. CO2 is *not* the climate control knob.2. The weather is *not* getting worse.3. There is no climate crisis.
Study after study shows that weather events are well with in the normal ranges and are historically lowMan made reporting that claims everywhere is getting twice as warm as everywhere else does. It make a crisis
I started out as a casual believer in AGW, then became more & more skeptical as I dug into the alleged evidence for myself. *Many* climate skeptics have followed a similar path. The ""climate crisis"" house of cards collapses quickly with a little fact-checking. #ClimateTwitter
Greta made it all about her from the very start. There is no climate crisis & there is no scientific proof of a climate crisis. Any belief in a pending extinction/apocalypse is climate change cultism like we see with extinction rebellion. pic.twitter.com/2vsB0BpuDF
​Many social media comments repeated previous words addressed to the climate activist teen to “go back to school”.
So go back to school, instead of traveling all around the world, emitting CO2 and learn about how does the climat works.
A vote for the #climatehoax is a vote against humanity
Greta go back to school honey. The sun dictates weather. Not Co2 that is facts.
When ever I question my path in life - I always look to a highschool drop out funded by Soros to give me advice. .Thanks Greta. Gonna sit alone and shame myself all day now. (Just doing my part! 👍)
@GretaThunberg owes it to the public to comment on the letter to the United Nations from 500 leading scientists stating that there is no climate crisis, arguing it point by point.pic.twitter.com/QWLV6cwyr2
""It’s all about scientific facts.""I wish it were true. Sadly, it isn't. Don't worry, though: Everybody is wrong at 17. I was, too.
Teen Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who has argued the case for climate issues since her first strike outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018, was thrown into the spotlight after her impassioned plea for action at the UN General Assembly Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019.
While Thunburg's activism has earned her accolades among those who believe anthropomorphic climate change, which contributed to her being named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019, she has been repeatedly criticised by many high-profile figures, who have deplored her approach as too confrontational, divisive, and at times misinformed.
Still others insist that her notoriety was manufactured by the green movement, and denounced her for doing things such as crossing the ocean in a multi-million dollar zero-emissions yacht, despite the option being effectively out of reach for all but the wealthiest travellers.

** Swedes Think Climate Policy Worst Waste of Taxpayers' Money in ... **

The authors of the poll explained the Swedes' vote as being due to the fact that while the Swedish government has invested loads of money into climate action policies, the actual amount of carbon dioxide emissions has slightly increased.
Swedish citizens have voted for climate policy as the worst waste of taxpayers' money, a poll conducted by the Swedish Taxpayers' Association revealed earlier this week.
Out of 18,000 citizens who took part in the poll, about 30 percent voted against national climate policies.
The poll says that in Sweden's budget for 2020, 12.6 billion krona ($1.3 billion) has been allocated to climate action, compared with 5.2 billion krona ($547 million) in 2014. Back in 2017, the National Institute of Economic Research even said that the government's budget risked becoming ""a costly blow in the air"".
Given the amount of money and lack of actual positive results for the environment, Gustafsson suggested that it would be more beneficial if the government's funds would be diverted into something valuable.
Sweden is one of the leading nations in advocating for environment-friendly initiatives, including trends like electric bicycles and solar cells.

Bernard Looney, who was born in Ireland, takes over as chief executive from Bob Dudley. Mr Looney joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer and ended up leading their upstream division, which includes oil and gas exploration and production.
BP shut down its head office in London on Wednesday, 5 February, after climate change protesters tried to block the entrance.
The demonstration coincided with Chief Executive Bernard Looney's first day in office.
Greenpeace spokesman Stefano Gelmini said police arrested 12 activists but the police put the number detained as nine.

** Climate Change Could Pose 'Catastrophic' Global Security Threats ... **

A new report by the National Security, Military and Intelligence Panel of the Center of Climate and Security found that climate change could pose great threats to “security environments, infrastructure and institutions” if global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.

According to the center’s report, which was  published Monday, “even at scenarios of low warming, each region of the world will face severe risks to national and global security in the next three decades.”
The researchers also found that even at low levels of warming, “dry and arid regions, least-developed countries, small island states, and the Arctic polar region” will become even more vulnerable. Due to the fact that such areas are involved in “significant military engagement,” continued warming will likely destabilize them. 
The report also found that industrialized regions of the world will experience “catastrophic effects,” “high levels of migration” and a “breakdown of key infrastructure and security institutions” due to global warming. 
In addition, the researchers warn that even the emissions levels set by the Paris Climate Agreement, which was created within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015 so that countries could set limits on their greenhouse gas outputs, are not enough to prevent such catastrophes from occurring. 
The researchers also predict that average global temperatures will increase by between 2.3 and 4.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. 
“Even if all existing climate policies are implemented, we are on track to increase global temperatures by as high as 3.2°C by the end of the century,” the report warns.
Given the report’s findings, the researchers recommend “quickly reducing and phasing out global greenhouse gas emissions,” calling on the world to achieve net-zero global emissions as soon as possible. In addition, the world must adopt “climate-proof environments, infrastructure, institutions, and systems on which human security depends, and so we call for rapidly building resilience to current and expected impacts of climate change,” the reports notes. 
The researchers also urge the US to renew its efforts to respond to climate security threats. 
In September 2019, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also warned that the consequences of climate change would be “sweeping” and “severe.” The panel’s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate revealed that oceans are getting warmer and more acidic due to increased absorption of carbon dioxide, and their concentration of oxygen is lowering. The report also noted that ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has contributed to rising sea levels, which will increase by 1.1 meters by 2100 if emissions continue at their current rate. Without dramatic decreases in greenhouse gas emissions, the frequency of hurricanes and flash flooding will continue to grow, the report warned at the time.

Amazon chief Bezos, who is considered the richest man in the world with a net worth of some $130 billion, earlier said his company was determined to become carbon-neutral by the year 2040.
Jeff Bezos has announced he is investing $10 Billion in the fight against climate change with the newly launched Bezos Earth Fund.
In an Instagram post on Monday, Bezos said that the new initiative would provide funding for scientists, activists, and non-governmental organisations to explore ways to fight climate change, with the Amazon CEO claiming that ""collective action"" was needed to preserve the environment.
Today, I’m thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. We can save Earth. It’s going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organizations, and individuals. ⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ I’m committing $10 billion to start and will begin issuing grants this summer. Earth is the one thing we all have in common — let’s protect it, together.⁣⁣⁣ ⁣⁣⁣ - Jeff

The announcement comes amid recent calls from inside Amazon to do more on the issue of climate change. In late January, more than 350 employees, united under the ""Amazon Workers for Climate Justice"", slammed the company's climate policies and demanded Amazon spend more money on saving the environment, according to Business Insider. One of the demands of the group was for the company to reach carbon-neutrality by 2030.

Whilst we have a global outbreak of Coronavirus, spoilt school kids led by the 'pigtailed puppet' Greta Thunberg are demonstrating and striking in Bristol today.
This event should have been cancelled and these kids should be sent back to school. The Lefty teachers who have encouraged this truanting also need to be sacked immediately they deign to go back to their classrooms.
In my previous column, I talked about the need for Boris to get a grip on this inevitable pandemic and it appears he is listening as at last, it looks like he is having the discussions that should have been had weeks ago.
There is now much talk of major sporting events being cancelled like the Six Nations Rugby and I am predicting, despite what the Cheltenham Festival organisers are saying this morning, that the Gold Cup event will have to be cancelled too.
If the Government are now, at last, telling people to self-isolate and major events are being cancelled, why on earth are we allowing this ""school strike"" event to happen?
Schools are being closed the length and breadth of the UK but up to 60 thousand snotty-nosed, brainwashed kids are being allowed to gather in Bristol?
Have they also considered the environmental impact of Mummy and Daddy driving them into the city and dropping them off in their Volvos?
Simply put, this genuflecting at the altar of Greta has got to stop.
The only good news is that Storm Jorge is rolling in and may well wash some of these snowflakes away. But seriously, the police should not be having to deal with this event either, frankly, this is the wrong event at the wrong time.
Final question, why can't they protest on a Saturday rather than in school time? I wonder? Why couldn’t they protest last week during half term? Answers on a postcard, please.
But of course, the two words you can never criticise are ""Climate and Change"". The MSM and politicians of all shades have been convinced that we are facing a ""climate emergency"". I don't know about man's contribution to global warming but there is certainly lots of hot air around the subject, even hysteria.
However, I am sorry to rain on Greta's disciples' parade but I have to tell them that the public is not so convinced. If we were, then the Greens would have more than one MP and have to find a bigger room than a phone box to hold their party conference
But if you dare to raise your head above the parapet and say you disagree then, if you're a scientist like David Bellamy, your TV career is over.
If like me you are just a cynic about man-made climate change, you are labelled a ""Boomer"", an ""old man picking on a young girl"" or ""pale, stale and white"". What on earth the colour of my skin has to do with this debate is beyond me, but so be it!
This climate hysteria is now seriously getting out of hand we even had the inept and useless mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, celebrating on Twitter yesterday about the court case stopping the third runway at Heathrow.
This man is meant to represent Londoners and he is celebrating that the main European airline hub for travellers will now move to Amsterdam or Germany! He is an absolute clown!
Sadiq, you are the Mayor of London and your responsibility is to Londoners and their economy and jobs. You are not a student activist, grow up you SJW, virtue signalling woke fool.
Not content with ceding the streets to the murdering knife-wielding and gun-toting yobs, he is now throwing away a major employment opportunity. But the delicious irony is that he will probably get re-elected. I don’t know about the ""woke"" but Londoners are sleepwalking into a nightmare if they re-elect this Muppet.
Then, of course, the King and Queen of the WOKE are back in the UK. Well at least ""just call me Harry"" is. How many more transatlantic flights is he going to take whilst lecturing us on Global warming?
He was in Edinburgh to launch some kind of eco-travel agency, I must admit I didn't pay much attention to what he was bleating on about, apart from the fact that after travelling by plane to London he then travelled to the Scottish capital on a train.
That was so eco-friendly, wasn't it? Until we learned that he booked out a whole first-class carriage for himself and his entourage. Very eco!
However, he won't need so many seats in the future as the Canadians have stated, in no uncertain terms, that when he finally stops being a royal (and let's face it, his retirement is taking longer than Yul Brynner's death scene in the King and I) they will no longer pay for his security.
I do hope we follow suit as I don’t see why we should be picking up the tab for this leeching pair as they build their tawdry Hollywood careers on the back of our Royal family and history.
When will all this hypocritical nonsense finish?
Will it take the collapse of the world's economy to convince politicians, silly teenagers and lefty teachers that there will be no world to save if we don't get on top of this coronavirus outbreak?
We are literally fiddling whilst Rome and many other capital cities are burning. The stock markets are falling like a stone and have had their worst week since the financial crash in 2008.
This is the real world, not the fantasy politics of offsetting your carbon footprint by getting Elton John to plant a few trees and marching through Bristol in the rain.
Grown-ups, and by that I mean politicians, need to get a grip and ban flights, cancel big public events and close our borders immediately.

Online dating platform OkCupid has caught the attention of those on both sides of the climate change debate after recently announcing that its website’s filter now has an option associated with the heated issue. 
OkCupid announced last month that it would be rolling out a new filter category, allowing users to narrow their search results down to potential mates who hold similar views concerning the subject of climate change.
On our app you can filter out anybody who thinks climate change is Fake News.
While climate change has become a topic of international urgency, the internet, naturally, is not able to come to consensus on the matter, and that divide was well represented in the responses to OkCupid’s announcement.
Can I get reverse filter with same criteria? I want to meet non-brainwashed people!
You’re so woke for rejecting thousands of scientists who spend their lives studying our world and letting us know what’s up. Lol #FakeNews amirite
Brilliant. Can you also remove these people from the app entirely? The stupidity and ignorance among these people present a fundamental risk to the world and they should not procreate.
It's almost like the science... Got better? No way, science couldn't get better in 40 years.
You do realize there's nothing anyone can do about it. There's this gigantic orb in the center of the solar system that it primarily affects the planets temperature. Humans have this overwhelming need to feel important. Newsflash, you're not.
There are a loooot of people not gettin laid and angry in these comments lmfao
when did ok cupid become the thought police?
The incels are angry in the replies pic.twitter.com/a8yXGtapFo
https://t.co/7qKv1gAFyX
Interestingly enough, the release of the research report coincided with a number of promoted tweets purchased by OkCupid on Twitter - as some users pointed out.
Bruh, this is the 3rd promoted tweet from you guys just from tonight. pic.twitter.com/iEcrAbx1d6
The online dating platform recently decided to poke the bear once again around Valentine’s Day by making its own position on climate change very clear.
Valentine card idea: “Like climate change, my love for you is very real.”
Additionally, the site has seen a 240% uptick in mentions of the topic on users’ profiles in the past year. Kaye specifically noted that there was an increase in terms such as “climate change,” “environment,” “Greta Thunberg,” and “recycle,” being used on user profiles when compared to past data.

Poor water infrastructure in the US could put some marginalized communities at risk, especially amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mary Grant, the director of the Public Water for All Campaign at Food & Water Watch and a policy analyst on US water utility privatization, told Radio Sputnik’s Loud & Clear Friday.

“World Water Day is every year on March 22, and it’s a program of the United Nations,” Grant told host John Kiriakou. “And it’s supposed to celebrate access and promotion of universal access to safe water and sanitation. This year’s theme was water and climate change, how climate change is impacting our water system, but it happened during this global pandemic. So the theme that was taken on was the importance of water, handwashing and sanitation and public health.”
“So, what we see is that in the US, there’s still about 2 million people who lack water, in the US right now. It’s water that’s unsafe. They don’t have indoor plumbing. This is particularly true among the Navajo nation, in indigenous communities, lacking basic infrastructure and indoor plumbing in the US. We also have many communities across the country with unsafe water, water that's contaminated. Health-based contamination of drinking water quality disproportionately impacts rural communities, communities of color and low-income communities in the US. So, across the country, people are struggling with basic access to safe water,” Grant said. 
“On top of all of this, our water systems are aging. They’re reaching the end of their youthful lives. We need to spend more than $35 billion a year just to comply with existing federal law in the US. And so, this is putting a huge burden on localities that are passing costs on to their rate payers, and we are seeing water rates go up across the country. They’ve increased by three times the rate of inflation for the past 15 years, and it’s really putting a burden on local households,” Grant told Sputnik.
“Utilities typically use one of two collection methods that are rather punitive. The most common one is the shutoff: we estimate that as many as 15 million Americans experience a water shutoff a year for nonpayment. So, they struggle to pay their basic water bills and to have that basic water access. So, that affordability crisis in particular is getting worse right now,” Grant explained.
The 2017 study also found that if water bills increase at estimated rates over the next five years, “conservative projections estimate that the percentage of U.S. households who will find water bills unaffordable could triple from 11.9% to 35.6%.”
With more than 101,000 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus in the US, water shutoffs could pose a great danger to people trying to protect themselves from the disease.
Climate change and water systems are “so inextricably related,” Grant added.
“Climate change is affecting access to water, and water affects climate change too. Water is getting warmer, leading to more contamination. We have more weather events … which causes more runoff, which causes more contamination of water supplies. So, these hydrological systems are so interconnected, you can’t talk about one without talking about the other. And one of the biggest impacts of climate change is going to be on our water systems - access to safe water, access to water at all. We’re seeing scarcity around the world. In the US, it’s in the western states in particular where water scarcity is going to be a big issue. On the East Coast, it’s too much water, causing water runoff and contamination of water supplies,” Grant said.

According to various estimates, from 15,000 up to 30,000 people attended the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate rally last Friday, which took place on Bristol's College Green.
The residents of Bristol are angry at popular eco-activist Greta Thunberg after her supporters ruined the city's historic green.
Tens of thousands of people attended a climate change rally where Thunberg gave a speech before leading a march around Bristol.   
In rainy weather, much of the grass where people stood turned into mud. 
A fundraiser was set up after the rally, with some people calling on the organisers to compensate for the damaged green.
Jon Usher, head of partnerships of Bristol-based charity Sustrans, who set up a GoFundMe page, said, as quoted by BBC: 
The aftermath of the Bristol rally has been widely discussed on social media.
OH THE IRONYA fundraising page has been set up to repair College Green in Bristol after it was turned into a mud bath by crowds at today's climate strike. Thousands of people gathered in the rain to listen to Greta Thunberg deliver her message on protecting the environment. pic.twitter.com/LTUBvaL2pq
So environment lovers wrecked the environment! You couldn't write it. Instead of crowdfunding, why don't those who were there give up their pocket money and pay to repair the damage themselves
I think @GretaThunberg should be paying to repair this. It’s her spouting nonsense that caused it.
They cry about climate change and destroy the grass that they are so supposed to defending!! Isn’t it Ironic???

In 2018, Thunberg left school to pursue environmental activism. She has since organised numerous protests in Sweden, including in front of the Swedish Parliament, urging students to skip school every Friday in order to protest against climate change.
Sixteen-year-old environmental activist from Sweden Greta Thunberg gives a speech during a committee session on EU climate law at the European Parliament.
She is also expected to meet with President of the Parliament David Sassoli later in the day. The activist will take part in the European Climate strike in Brussels on Friday, 6 March.

The UK Space Agency has selected Sutherland, on the Moine Peninsula of Scotland's north coast, as the location of Britain's first-ever domestic spaceport. The launch facility would reportedly be developed by US aerospace and defence giant Lockheed Martin.
The site is projected to launch satellites and space vehicles, boosting Scotland's already rapidly growing satellite industry. According to The Daily Mail, it is said that the United Kingdom expects to put some 2,000 satellites into Earth orbit by 2030.
But Britain's aspirations have been challenged by an unexpected obstacle. A 12-year-old boy, Finlay Pringle, a UK-based climate change activist from Scotland, has firmly objected to the construction of a UK spaceport.
Pringle, reportedly dubbed Scotland's leading young environmentalist and 'Britain's Greta Thunberg', lodged a formal protest over the construction of an enormous spaceport in the southeast of Tongue, in the far north of Scotland, asserting that the launchpad would be located close to Europe's largest peat bog and a possible UNESCO world heritage site, The Daily Mail said.
According to research quoted by the activist, the spaceport will annually release up to 950 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.
The owner of the site in Sutherland, Melness Crofters Estate (MCE), has argued that the local community is looking for a balance between protection of the environment and development of local infrastructure.

                    Flickr / Cory DoctorowEyes In The Sky: Britain's GCHQ Sets Sights on SpaceAccording to the owner of the site, activists running a ""sustained, vociferous campaign"" had ""misrepresented"" the spaceport and the intentions of the MCE. The media report suggested that the MCE could fund local community from space facility income. The enormous launch site would include a launch control centre, a single launch pad and associated infrastructure, including roadways, fuel storage, office premises, and antennas.
Pringle reportedly pointed out that one of the main environmental objections to the site's location is the expected impact on the peat bogs - partly due to their unique habitat, and also as they are a ""vital carbon sink"". According to the media report, Pringle seeks to have those key points made more widely known.
""We need people in authority to take the climate and ecological breakdowns seriously, refusing planning for this project would be a good start and signal the council is prepared to take positive action on climate change"" Pringle said.
According to local media reports, Pringle has been praised for his environmental activism by Greta Thunberg.

New Delhi (Sputnik): Millions of people across the world stuck at home now due to the raging coronavirus will participate in the Earth Hour event on Saturday.
In a bid to draw people’s attention to climate change, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) initiated a symbolic lights-out event in Australia called the #EarthHour in 2007.
Over a decade later, Earth Hour has become one of the world’s largest grassroots movements focused on saving the environment, celebrated every year on 28 March.
On Saturday, Indians also began pledging their support for the #EarthHour movement, which now comprises 180 countries.

UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- An African Union (AU) envoy on Wednesday said the regional group and the United Nations need to enhance efforts to address climate change.
Fatima Kyari Mohammed, AU permanent observer to the United Nations, pointed to the increasing need to enhance the two bodies' joint regional approaches to climate security, especially for the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and other affected areas.
She noted the impacts of climate change are exacerbating existing tensions across these regions, as can be seen in the increase of inter-communal tensions and clashes in various parts of the continent.
While the AU has deployed various efforts towards timely response in disaster situations, she said, joint preventive efforts should also be considered.
Mohammed made the remarks at a Security Council meeting on the UN-AU partnership.
She further said the two bodies should step up cooperation in peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction, while recognizing progress made in efforts to prevent and manage conflicts.
The United Nations has recently highlighted the serious flooding in Somalia, a Horn of African country, where over 180,000 people were estimated to have been displaced. Farmland, infrastructure and roads were destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas.

** Hong Kong to strengthen ability to combat climate change - Xinhua ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-10/18/c_138483562.htm *

HONG KONG, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) -- Shun Chi-ming, director of the Hong Kong Observatory, said Hong Kong had been hit by super typhoons in recent years and should gear up to combat climate change.
The Hong Kong Observatory said in a statement on Friday that it jointly hosted an academic session with two working groups of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Thursday in Hong Kong.
Featuring the salient points of the three special reports published by the IPCC in the past year, the session provided participants with the opportunity to discuss and exchange views on the latest scientific findings in the field of climate change and its relevance to Hong Kong.
The three reports are the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, the Special Report on Climate Change and Land, and the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which summarized the impacts of climate change on land, ocean, the cryosphere and ecosystems.
According to the reports, the land surface air temperature has risen nearly twice as much as the global average temperature since the pre-industrial period, leading to more frequent and intense weather extremes.
Furthermore, if global carbon emissions continue to show no signs of abating, the global sea level rise for year 2100 is projected to be 10 cm higher than that in the previous assessment, representing a 14-percent increase.
At the meeting, Shun cited the destructive power of storm surges brought to Hong Kong by super typhoons Hato and Mangkhut in 2017 and 2018 respectively. He stressed that Hong Kong is not immune to the impacts of climate change, and mitigation, adaptation and resilience measures are most important in combating climate change.
Shun added that the Hong Kong Observatory will continue to provide scientific input to support the work of the relevant departments of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government. It will also make ongoing efforts to help raise public awareness of climate change and its impacts through education, so as to enhance the community's preparedness and resilience.

VIENNA, Oct. 7 (Xinhua) -- Climate change is one of the greatest challenges to the world, but reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be difficult to achieve without a significant increase in the use of nuclear power, according to the acting chief of UN nuclear watchdog at a conference held here on Monday.
""It is difficult to see how the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved without a significant increase in the use of nuclear power in the coming decades,"" said Cornel Feruta, Acting Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in the opening remarks at the International Conference on Climate Change and the Role of Nuclear Power.
""Advances being made in several countries concerning the final disposal of high-level radioactive waste may help alleviate public concerns about the long-term sustainability of nuclear power,"" he added.
Some 550 participants representing 79 countries and 18 international organizations are taking part in the week-long conference, the first on this topic organized by the IAEA.
Held in cooperation with the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the event serves as ""a unique forum for exchanging science-based information and conducting objective discussions on the role of nuclear power in mitigating climate change"", according to the official website of IAEA.
Currently, 30 countries operate 449 nuclear power reactors worldwide, generating 10 percent of the world's electricity and one third of all low-carbon electricity. In terms of emissions avoidance, that's the equivalent of taking 400 million cars off the road every year, according to Feruta.

UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Ursula Mueller has urged the international community to take immediate action to confront the climate crisis that is heavily affecting Djibouti and the rest of Horn of Africa.
ADDIS ABABA, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- The UN Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Ursula Mueller, has urged the international community to take immediate action to confront the climate crisis that is heavily affecting Djibouti and the rest of Horn of Africa.
Mueller, who is also Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator in the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), made the urgent call at the end of a three-day mission to Djibouti, from October 2 to 4, UNOCHA said in a statement on Saturday.
""Climate change is real, and I could see it here. I saw the widespread drought and I met communities that can barely access safe water. They explained to me how this situation is impacting their lives. Djibouti has made virtually no contribution to the global climate emergency, but its population is suffering the consequences on a daily basis,"" UNOCHA statement quoted Mueller as saying.
Throughout the region, recurrent droughts, water scarcity and other climate shocks have been drivers of high levels of malnutrition, disease outbreaks, food insecurity and displacement, triggering an increase in humanitarian needs, according to UNOCHA.
According to UNOCHA, large areas of Djibouti are exposed to extreme weather conditions, affecting water availability and hygiene conditions, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks. Coupled with high levels of poverty and unemployment, this has left more than 280,000 people, one in three Djiboutians, in chronic levels of food insecurity.

""Severe acute malnutrition rates are alarming and considered an emergency according to global standards. In Bondara village, women told me how they were doing whatever it takes to put food on the table for the family, but the frequent droughts are preventing them from doing so,"" said Mueller.
The Red Sea nation is also a major route of migration with 400 to 600 migrants crossing daily, fleeing the impact of conflict, instability and harsh climate in neighboring countries. The country is also home to some 30,000 refugees and asylum-seekers and an estimated 100,000 migrants.
The deputy humanitarian chief, who also visited one of the refugee villages in Ali Addeh close to Djibouti's border with Ethiopia and Somalia, also met with community representatives and a women's group to learn more about their particular needs.
""The most basic needs are being met. However, there is a lack of livelihood opportunities that would allow the refugees to become self-reliant,"" she said.
Mueller, who also met with Djibouti's Prime Minister, Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed, as well as several ministers, also commended government initiatives to support people who are most in need of assistance.
At the end of her visit, the deputy humanitarian chief mainly highlighted that urgent action is required to address the underlying causes of vulnerabilities and get on a path to sustainable development in Djibouti and the region.

** Sri Lanka dedicated to addressing climate change: parliament speaker **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-10/26/c_138505339.htm *

COLOMBO, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Saturday that the country was dedicated to addressing climate change and taking all steps necessary to mitigate the crisis brought about by it.
Speaking at ""Sri Lanka - NEXT 2019"" conference held in the capital Colombo, Jayasuriya said Sri Lanka was a signatory to the Paris Agreement and was ready to adopt measures which would mitigate the crisis as the consequences of it were highly vulnerable and intense.
""Global politics revolve around climate change and world leaders cannot ignore the climate change crisis. This has a huge impact on the ultimate vote, visionary direction of a country and its environment governance. The phenomenon of climate change is independent from a country's magnitude, geo-political boundary or its political leadership,"" Jayasuriya said.
Sri Lanka was ranked second in the countries worst affected by climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index for 2019.
The report said heavy landslides and floods hit Sri Lanka after strong monsoon rains lashed south-western regions of the country in May 2017, and more than 200 people died after the worst rains in the country since 2003.
The monsoons displaced more than 600,000 people from their homes and 12 districts were affected.
In 2018 and 2019, several more deaths were reported from the annual monsoon rains.

QUITO, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- President of Ecuador, Lenin Moreno, will discuss his country's efforts in the fight against climate change at the UN Climate Change Conference COP 25, which will take place in Madrid, Spain, from December 2 to 13, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Jose Valencia said on Friday.
The head of Ecuador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility stated during a televised interview that at the COP25, Moreno would present ""the different efforts"" his government was making to ""contribute to this global international fight against the warming of the atmosphere.""
According to Valencia, Moreno will address two issues that are important for Ecuador, the first of which is related to the commitments the country has made to limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
The other central issue which Moreno will touch on is the impact of climate change and other phenomena on the Galapagos Islands.
He stated that the islands are ""a national treasure,"" and were declared a Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 1978 by the United Nations Education, Science, and Culture Organization (UNESCO).
The Galapagos Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, about 970 kilometers off the coast of mainland Ecuador.
Moreno will visit the Spanish capital between November 30 and December 4 to participate in the COP25, accompanied by an official committee headed by Valencia.
Moreno will participate in a meeting of Latin American presidents and in a round table discussion where the issue of how ""countries are preparing to fight climate change"" will be addressed, Valencia said.
He added that Moreno will also meet with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, as well as King Felipe VI of Spain, in addition to a bilateral meeting with the acting Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez.

SUVA, Nov. 1 (Xinhua) -- Global solutions through multilateralism is needed to address climate change due to its nature as a global problem, a Fijian minister said on Friday.
Speaking at the Global Climate Change Alliance Plus (GCCA) - Scaling-up Pacific Adaptation (SUPA) Project workshop in Labasa, capital of Fiji's northern island of Vanua Levu, Fiji's Minister for Agriculture, Rural and Maritime Development, Waterways and Environment Mahendra Reddy said that it is evident that climate change is one of the greatest challenges experienced in the history of humanity.
Fiji has been consistently ranked high in climate change vulnerability, among other countries in the South Pacific region.
""Our reliance on climatic sensitive sectors means it is vital that we enhance the climate resilience of Fiji's economy. The Global Climate Change Alliance Plus - Scaling-up Pacific Adaptation Project does exactly that, via scaling-up of past performing interventions,"" the minister said.
He said the Scaling up the Soasoa Drainage System for 2050 Project, which is part of the SUPA Project, was linked to meeting national objectives, as the project was aligned to the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and National Development Plan (NDP).
""The project is a National objective to scale-up efforts to strengthen coastal boundaries of urban centers and rural communities through hybrid or nature-based solutions to risk reduction purposes and to slow the need to relocate communities and infrastructure, while improving and maintaining drainage networks in urban and rural areas as measures to protect against inland floods, considering that drainage defects are the dominant cause of floods,"" said the minister.
The project also contributes to the rural economy through promoting equal opportunities, access to basic services and building resilient communities and providing a sustainable sugar industry through the provision of proper drainage services.

KIGALI, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- Climate change is a major global threat that needs strong and concerted efforts to tackle, legislators said here Tuesday at a joint parliamentary assembly of African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) and the European Union (EU).
""World leaders, policy-makers and climate change experts should go beyond rhetoric talk on climate change mitigation measures and come up with strong and concrete actions to tackle climate change,"" said Carlos Zorrinho, co-president of the ACP-EU joint parliamentary assembly, at the formal opening of the session.
The assembly, held on Nov. 17-21, focuses on wide-ranging topics, such as climate change, food security, migration and sustainable growth.
""Climate change often causes conflicts, migrations and natural disasters destroying lives and property. It is our duty as ACP-EU to work together towards combating disastrous effects of climate change,"" said Zorrinho, a member of the European Parliament.
Zorrinho said the world should strengthen efforts to avoid the worst impacts of the climate change in the near future.
""There is a need to come up with aggressive policies to fight climate change. As parliamentarians we are going to raise our voice and push world leaders to continue to influence global actions on climate change mitigation measures,"" said Ibrahima Memounatou, a member of the Parliament of Togo.
To push a climate action, much stronger engagement and leadership are also needed, said Memounatou.
Donatille Mukabalisa, speaker of Chamber of Deputies of Rwanda, said the increase of global temperature indicates that climate change is real and that needs concerted efforts to mitigate it.
""Climate change is affecting all regions of the world, but Africa is more vulnerable to climate change's disastrous effects than others,"" Mukabalisa said.
Rwanda's Senate President Augustin Iyamuremye called on the participants to reflect deeply on regional and global issues, and to focus their political will and efforts on an ambitious partnership to deal with climate change.

** Experts say climate change fueling California wildfires - Xinhua ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/30/c_138594279.htm *

by Julia Pierrepont III
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- Driven by record-breaking Santa Ana winds that carry dry air from the American West's Great Basin area into California, devastating fires have been sweeping through the Pacific state in recent years, driving hundreds of thousands of evacuees from their homes and decimating schools, vineyards, businesses and entire residential neighborhoods.
In 2019 alone, 6,402 fires have been reported, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) and the U.S. Forest Service, totaling an estimated of 253,475 acres of burned land as of Nov. 28. This includes the most recent Cave Fire in scenic Santa Barbara, which has consumed 3,126 acres Friday and remains only 40 percent contained despite recent rains.
This new trend in larger, faster, less containable wildfires showed no signs of abating, experts and officials said. In fact, they warned they were here to stay, due to climate change.
""Climate change has created a new reality in the state of California. It's not a question of 'if' wildfire will strike, but 'when,'"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said earlier.
""I'm not a climatologist,"" Ventura County Fire Department veteran Tony McHale told Xinhua in an exclusive interview early this month. ""But using my own 20-year experience in the field, things in California have definitely gotten hotter and fire seasons are much, much longer.""
He explained that when he was first hired two decades ago, the California fire season routinely ran from May until November. ""Now they are pretty much year round,"" he said.
""Our two priorities are saving lives and protecting property, but some of these fires are much bigger now and more dynamic and they move really fast. They can overwhelm a community and our initial fire resources very quickly,"" he told Xinhua.
""Is there evidence of climate change in the fire environment? You have to say 'yes,'"" Don Whittemore, a fire incident commander for 22 years in the western part of the country, said in a recent Nat Geo interview. ""Every indicator is: every year it just gets worse.""
The typical ""Western Fire Season"" in California used to run from June to September and struck most frequently in higher-elevation rural woodlands.
But a recent report co-authored by Fengpeng Sun, assistant professor of geosciences at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, identified a second fire season that spans from October to April. Its cause? Climate change, the report said.
California rains used to begin in October, but in recent years, dry periods have stretched into November, December, January, and even longer. This has lengthened the average fire season by at least 75 days, according to Cal Fire.
""We used to get more than two inches of rain in Northern California in October,"" said Derek Arndt, chief of the monitoring branch at the National Centers for Environmental Information, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Less than half of that reached California this year.
Unfortunately, this ""new normal"" second fire season is also expanding the burn zones into more densely populated areas.
""As global warming heats up California and human population continues to expand into more remote and rural areas,"" Yifei Sun, tenured professor of Geography and Environmental Studies at California State University, Northridge, told Xinhua Friday in an exclusive interview, ""That means many more chances of someone accidentally or deliberately igniting a random spark that can lead to a massive wildfire.""
Despite the Trump administration's assertion that global warming does not exist, scientific reports by experts in the field said that California had warmed by three degrees Fahrenheit over the past hundred years, a small temperature increase with an enormous impact.
""Background warming and consequent fuel drying is increasingly enhancing the potential for large fall wildfires,"" said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.
A report published by Williams and his colleagues said many of the most important variables that are increasing fire threats showed that California's increasingly drier landscapes, caused by climate warming trends, are ""the clearest link between anthropogenic climate change and increased California wildfire activity to date.""
In a report tasked with investigating California's climate change, catastrophic wildfires, and energy future, Governor Newsom revealed that 15 of the 20 most destructive wildfires in the state's history have occurred since 2000 and 10 of those since 2015.
""Wildfires don't discriminate --they are a rural, suburban and urban danger,"" Newsom warned.
""We need a more holistic plan to stop this,"" Sun said, ""One that acknowledges there is global climate change and takes into account our environment, population, cultures, fuel consumption, and other variables. People and governments need the political will to make the necessary changes to stop it.""

ROME, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the battle against climate change is the new frontier as he outlined the priorities for his government going forward during a year-end press conference here on Saturday.
Conte heads a coalition government made up of the Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement.
""The new frontier today is the fight against climate change,"" Conte told reporters during the three-hour press conference, which was televised live. ""We must fight for the implementation of the Paris accords, and spread this sensibility across all continents"".
He spoke in reference to the 2015 Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
The Italian prime minister also highlighted his government's achievements on immigration, saying that ""since September, we have been relocating 98 migrants per month"" and that he would work for more effective social integration of migrants who have a right to stay in Italy.
On the domestic front, Conte said the government will work to streamline bureaucracy, invest 34 percent of public spending in the country's underdeveloped south, modernize the country's infrastructure, cut taxes and fight tax evasion.
""If we can recover significant resources from the illegal economy, which according to some estimates is worth 100 billion euros (112 billion U.S. dollars), we can take concrete measures to cut taxes for everyone,"" Conte said.
He also announced that the Education Ministry will be split into two bodies following the resignation of Lorenzo Fioramonti as education minister earlier this week.
Conte said that Italy would have a ministry for schools and one for universities and research. He named Lucia Azzolina, current undersecretary of state of the Education Ministry, as the new schools minister and Gaetano Manfredi, rector of the University of Naples Federico II, as minister of universities and research.

The United Nations Climate Change Conference COP25 officially opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. (Xinhua)
MADRID, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) opened here on Monday, where delegates are discussing measures to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement amid unclear prospects and challenges to multilateralism.
The opening ceremony began with a warning from Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): ""If we continue as we are doing, we run the risk of increasing the temperature of the planet and that will have an effect and terrible consequences for humanity and threaten our existence.""
""We are not doing enough and we are not even getting close to what we need to do to control this situation,"" he said.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the world would need ""solidarity and flexibility to win the war against climate change.""
Guterres explained that there is only one way to control the temperature of the planet and that was ""limited use of fossil fuels. If we don't do that we will end up in a catastrophic situation,"" he warned, before praising the work of young climate activists.
""Young people are telling the leaders that they need to fight against the climate emergency,"" commented the UN chief.
The conference is hosted by the Spanish capital after Chile, which presides over the event, had to step down as host due to social unrest.
Acting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez welcomed delegates to Spain, saying ""Madrid will be the world capital of the fight against the climate emergency ... But above all we want to be the capital of dialogue between nations united against a common enemy for all humanity.""
He said that although the event was being held in Spain, it is being presided over by Chile. ""This is Chile's COP: it is Chile that has organized the leadership and that has worked for an alliance against climate change and the success of this event will belong to Chile.""
TIME FOR ACTION
The major task for the delegates is to discuss Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, the measures to promote voluntary international cooperation by paying a price on carbon, emission trading schemes and other market mechanisms.
The conference comes as global efforts to mitigate climate change are on the brink of failure.
""The global contributions to climate change fall far short,"" said Berthold Kuhn, an expert on sustainable development with the Free University of Berlin and senior advisor to the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute.
According to a UN Environment Programme report on the emissions gap published last week, countries have collectively failed to stop the growth in global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required.
The report says that emissions have gone up by 1.5 percent per year in the last decade. In 2018, emissions totaled 55 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is putting the Earth on course to experience a temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, rather than the 1.5 degree goal set in the Paris Agreement.
This critical situation has prompted the conference, which will last till Dec. 13, to choose ""Time for Action"" as its motto.
Kuhn believes that market mechanisms should be well designed to stimulate investment in projects like reforestation and other climate-friendly economic activities. Therefore, COP25 is of great importance to implement the Paris Agreement.
COOPERATION CRUCIAL
The event comes after the United States formally initiated its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement earlier last month, impacting global cooperation on climate change with its unilateral move.
""It will be more difficult for the world to stop climate change by reducing the annual emissions effectively to zero without the United States,"" said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
World leaders and experts are using COP25 as a venue for promoting multilateralism. Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, joined the event on Monday, saying that ""if we work together, we will go faster and we will be as ambitious as possible in the COP negotiations.""
Lu Xinming, deputy director general for climate change with China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told reporters on Sunday that China will try hard to conclude negotiations on the details of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
""One of the most important points is that China opposes any kind of unilateralism and safeguards the authority of multilateralism,"" said Lu, adding that China will work with other parties to help make the conference a success.

The phrase ""time for action"" is literally everywhere in Madrid after the organizers chose it as the motto for the conference and as its hashtag on Twitter.
And it really is time to act to address the climate change as data have repeatedly stressed the urgency of swift actions.
Days before the conference, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) released a report, saying that the ever-rising greenhouse emissions are putting the Earth on course for a temperature rise of 3.2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, rather than 2 degrees Celsius goal.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) issued a report on Wednesday, saying that average temperatures for the past decade are almost certain to be the highest ever recorded, while the WHO found that climate change is a threat to human health with problems such as heat stress, extreme weather and malaria.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the opening ceremony of COP25 that air pollution ""kills 7 million people"" every year and that climate change is ""a direct threat to human survival and human security.""
""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon, it is in sight and hurtling towards us,"" he warned.
""I have been working for climate change mitigation and I have been 25 years warning about the climate urgency and after urgency, they start talking about emergency,"" said Oswaldo Lucon, executive coordinator of Brazilian Forum on Climate Change, who also works for UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
According to Carolina Schmidt, chairwoman of the event and the Chilean environment minister, COP25 would focus on details of the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement, especially its Article 6, which covers measures to promote voluntary international cooperation by paying a price on carbon emission trading schemes and other market mechanisms.
Organizers say they are working together to make COP25 as sustainable and climate-friendly as possible, with measures to reduce paper use and manage waste disposal. Unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions associated with COP25 will be documented in a carbon footprint report prepared by Spain to be published next spring.

VENUE FOR MULTILATERALISM
Over 26,000 people from approximately 200 countries and regions take part in the event, which is divided into two zones, the Blue Zone for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Green Zone for civil societies, NGOs, companies and others.
The United States initiated the formal withdrawal process from the Paris Agreement in November. However, multilateralism still prevails over climate change issues.
Governments are displaying their achievements and ambitions in climate change mitigation, while in the booths of multilateral development financial institutions or UN agencies, people are talking about facilitating climate-friendly pilot projects such as wind or solar farms in developing countries.
Admittedly, there are some differences, such as developing countries hoping developed ones will support them more financially and technologically. Nevertheless, countries are sitting at the negotiating table.
""We are showing how multilateralism works,"" said Schmidt at a press briefing on Wednesday, ""no country can solve this by themselves. We make the impossible possible.""
""Climate change is a major platform for multilateralism,"" said Lucon, who believes that the threat of climate change speaks the same language for Brazil, China and any other country.
""The U.S. withdrawal did not cause a wave of withdrawals of other states. Almost all national governments are still in,"" Prof. Ottmar Edenhofer, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told Xinhua.
""That is because they know it makes a lot of sense to help reducing greenhouse gas emissions -- it's really our common interest to protect what we all share, like the atmosphere and ultimately climate stability,"" said Edenhofer, who believes that it is sad the U.S. government has chosen to deny the reality, but that in the long run, Washington will change its attitude as extreme climate events continue to hit the United States.

CHINA'S CRITICAL ROLE
China's Pavilion at the conference is worth a visit. Pictures on the wall in the pavilion highlight China's achievements and plans for climate change mitigation.
These pictures show China's sustained efforts to conserve its wetlands, manage the major ecologically vulnerable sites, and combat carbon emission by building wind farms and using more renewable energy vehicles.
As one of the biggest annual greenhouse gas emitter and the biggest developing country, China plays a central role in combatting global climate change and its commitment to the issue is widely recognized at the event.
""To make the change we need all the world. We have been working closely with China and its people to make those changes,"" said Schmidt. ""We have the commitment of China to still working with us for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.""
Lu Xinming, deputy director-general for climate change at China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, told reporters that China wants to send a strong political signal in support of multilateralism at COP25.
However, some developed countries have indicated that they are considering a carbon border adjustment tax.
""These unilateral acts will seriously undermine the world's willingness and confidence to cope with climate change and will ultimately affect the global efforts to address climate change,"" said Lu.
The event also takes place at a time when climate change has become one of the major topics around the world. For instance, just before the event, the European Parliament declared a ""climate and environmental emergency.""
Edenhofer believed that although the EU hopes to take the lead, it cannot change the world alone.
""Europe is ready to join forces with those who are willing to act, and China certainly can be an outstandingly important partner,"" said Edenhofer.

** China Focus: Leading with action in fighting climate change ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/03/c_138602916.htm *

BEIJING, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- China is taking leading actions in staving off climate change with widely recognized achievements, as a shortfall in global efforts calls for deeper and faster cuts in emission before ""terrible consequences for humanity"" descend.
The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) kicked off Monday in Madrid, Spain, with China pledging to try hard to conclude negotiations on the details of the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
""One of the most important points is that China opposes any kind of unilateralism and safeguards the authority of multilateralism,"" said Lu Xinming, deputy director general for climate change with China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment, adding that China will work with other parties to help make the conference a success.
China has been actively participating in global climate governance. It adheres to multilateralism and firmly upholds the framework and principles of global climate governance set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement and their detailed rules of implementation.
The following are some of the highlights of China's recent green efforts and acclaimed contribution to fighting global warming.
China has taken urgent actions to combat climate change and adopted effective policies to strengthen response, demonstrating its commitment to sustainable development and transformation to a low-carbon green economy, according to China's Progress Report on Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
A 2019 study using data from NASA satellites showed that China is leading the increase in greening on land. The researchers found that the global green leaf area has increased by 5 percent since the early 2000s, an area equivalent to all of the Amazon rainforests. At least 25 percent of that gain came in China.
By 2018, China had slashed carbon intensity by 45.8 percent from 2005 levels, meeting the target of a 40 to 45 percent decrease by 2020 ahead of schedule. The figure indicates that the country has avoided emitting 5.26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide since 2005.
Meanwhile, the share of non-fossil fuels in China's primary energy consumption rose from 12 to 14.3 percent from 2017 to 2018, and power generated from renewable energy sources accounted for 26.7 percent of total power output in 2018.
China is taking the lead in renewable energy to meet its commitments, investing 126.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2017 alone and creating enough capacity to power the United Kingdom seven times over, according to leading Swiss financial institution UBS.
China's shift to renewable energy is part of a significant transition that offers a roadmap for developing countries and helps drive technological breakthroughs that will drive down the costs of renewables for consumers everywhere.
""No other country has come close to matching China's dominance in transitioning to a low carbon economy,"" wrote Michael Baldinger, an official in charge of sustainable and impact investing with UBS, in a research note.
As China continues to reduce its energy intensity, its experience can offer a roadmap for developing countries. Meanwhile, its investments in renewables, both at home and abroad, can help to drive additional technological breakthroughs that drive down the costs of those renewables for consumers everywhere, Baldinger said.
Inger Anderson, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said China ""has had a tremendous success in demonstrating climate leadership in recent years"" through large investments in clean energy and technologies, electric mobility and wide-scale land restoration.
""The problems we face today -- especially environmental ones -- are no longer confined to individual countries or regions. They are global in scope and scale. And an effective response will also be global. For that, we need a staunch multilateralism, and I am pleased to see China taking an active role in promoting this approach,"" she said.

** UK to use satellite technology to help tackle climate change - Xinhua ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/31/c_138667659.htm *

LONDON, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) -- A new satellite data center will analyze the impact climate change is having on Britain, help shape policies on reducing carbon emissions, and contribute to reaching net zero targets, the UK government announced on Monday.
The Center for Satellite Data in Environmental Science (SENSE), is a virtual academic collaboration and is being established with funding from the Natural Environment Research Council and the UK Space Agency.
It involves the University of Edinburgh and the University of Leeds, and will use cutting-edge satellite technology to help combat climate change, including helping lower the risk of people being affected by flooding. The data center will bring together 50 of the UK's brightest and best PhD researchers to help solve climate change, according to the government.
Measurements from satellites on rising sea levels, greenhouse gases and shrinking glaciers and forests will help provide policy makers, government and industry with the data and knowledge they need to better understand the impact of climate change and make future predictions, the government said.
""This new satellite data centre will give us instant images showing us the true impact of climate change and in doing so, help us develop innovative new ways of tackling it,"" said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom in a statement.
Earth observation experts from the University of Edinburgh and the University of Leeds will work with 18 businesses on pioneering work to monitor the impact of climate change.

CANBERRA, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is facing renewed pressure to pursue more ambitious climate change policies amid an escalating bushfire crisis.
Bushfires in five Australian states have escalated, with the death toll for the fire season rising to at least 17.
The air quality in Canberra, the nation's capital, was the worst in the world on Wednesday and Thursday as the city was covered in thick smoke from more than 100 fires in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria.
Prime Minister Morrison on Wednesday described the fires as ""a time of great challenge for Australia,"" but said that previous generations have faced similar crises and rejected calls to pursue ambitious climate policies.
In a significant move, the NSW branch of the Young Liberals, the youth movement of Morrison's Liberal Party, on Thursday called on the government to make policy changes to address ""extraordinary challenges presented by human induced climate change.""
Chaneg Torres, the president of the NSW Young Liberals, told Nine Entertainment newspapers that the governing body of the movement voted unanimously in December to push for greater action on climate change.
""The NSW Young Liberal movement is reflecting the views of our generation in recognising the reality of human induced climate change and the need for government policy to respond accordingly,"" he said.
""Climate change is a phenomenon that will affect our generation's future. Intergenerational equity requires that governments take the challenge seriously now for the sake of our generation.""
Australia has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate agreement.

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-01/01/c_138671171.htm *

SUVA, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Fijian Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama stressed on Wednesday the importance of dealing with climate change, saying if the global community does not act to decisively cut emissions, these storms Fiji has experienced will only become more severe in the years ahead.
Speaking in his New Year message on Wednesday, Bainimarama said that many Fijian families have had a rough start to the new year as tropical cyclone Sarai swept across the island nation, flooding roadways, knocking out power and severing critical services.
He said that his total focus is on the Fijians who - through no fault on their own - are recovering from yet another bout of severe weather. They will get services back online, and they will continue to invest in more resilient infrastructure, construct seawalls, plant mangroves and implement other adaptive measures.
While cyclones have always been a part of life in Fiji, the frequency of extreme weather is a ruthless reminder of Fiji's high vulnerabilities to climate impacts, he said, adding that the increasing frequency and intensity of these storms is one reason why Fiji has been ranked as one of the 10 countries in the world most affected by climate change.
""This stark reality is why Fiji fights unapologetically in the international arena to push high-emitting countries to combat climate change. We cannot allow headlines telling of storms wreaking havoc in our region to become routine. We cannot - we will not - allow the world to become numb to what we are experiencing,"" the prime minister said.
He pointed out that if the global community does not act to decisively cut emissions, these storms will only become more severe in the years ahead. That would be an unacceptable reality for Fiji, their neighbouring Pacific Island countries, and every other nation and people on earth.
In 2016, Fiji was hit by tropical cyclone Winston, which killed 44 people and caused extensive damages to the island country.

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/31/c_138667588.htm *

VILNIUS, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania's government on Monday approved the updated National Energy and Climate Action Plan for 2021-2030, estimating that the measures involved would require about 14 billion euros of investments.
""The active involvement of business, non-governmental organizations and citizens in the preparation of this plan confirms that the climate change is an issue of concern to the whole society. Lithuania's updated climate change plan is ambitious and should serve as the guidelines for investment in the EU's next financial perspective,"" Energy Minister Zygimantas Vaiciunas was quoted as saying in a statement released by his ministry.
The plan foresees Lithuania's actions to combat climate change in the next decade. Five key directions have been set in the plan - reducing dependency on fossil fuels, energy efficiency, energy security, developing the internal energy market, developing research and innovation.
According to the plan, Lithuania should have renewable energy sources accounting for 45 percent of its total energy consumption by 2030.
Should all measures are implemented, greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 8.1 percent in Lithuania's transport sector, by 9.1 percent in agriculture, by 9.8 percent in industry and by 52.4 percent in the waste management sector.
The national plan will be submitted to the European Commission, which is expected to give its assessment on national plans by June 2020, the ministry said in the statement. (one euro currently equals to 1.12 U.S. dollars)

BERLIN, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for efforts to tackle climate change in her New Year's speech broadcast on Tuesday.
""The warming of our planet is real, threatening,"" Merkel said. ""The crises arising from global warming are man-made. So we have to do everything humanly possible to meet this challenge to humanity.""
Merkel said the younger generation, people's ""children and grandchildren"", will have to live with the consequences of climate change if politicians do not act.
She promised to use ""all her strength"" to ensure Germany ""makes its contribution ecologically, economically and socially to getting climate change under control.""
The German parliament has passed a wide-ranging climate package, which includes reform plans to reduce rail prices and increase taxes on air travel.
Merkel referred to the policies, which are set to take effect on Jan. 1 after months of wrangling, as a necessary framework for her government's efforts to tackle climate change.

ADDIS ABABA, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- The President of International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Peter Maurer, has called for humanitarian support along with long-term development solution to deal with the situations of people in the Horn of Africa, where peoples' lives are affected by climate change and violence.
The ICRC President on Wednesday wrapped up his visit in the region, where he said millions of people are trapped in near-constant crisis as the combination of droughts, floods, and violence force people from their homes and erode already-fragile livelihoods.
After meeting with officials at the Peace and Security Council of the African Union (AU) on Thursday in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, Maurer told Xinhua that he had seen on the ground that communities in the region, despite different situations from country to country, are affected by climate change as well as war and violence.
""When I see communities on the ground, they reflect on the impact of climate change on their lives, and the impact of war and violence on their lives.""
""When I was in Jigjiga, in Ethiopia talking to communities, it was interesting to hear them about the conflict, which has destroyed infrastructure, which has affected communities, which has led them to displacement, and on the one hand see how the dynamics of climate change accentuate and exacerbate some of the humanitarian challenges. That is the phenomenon which makes humanitarian response more complex.""
The ICRC president has underlined the need to address both humanitarian and development issues in a coordinated manner.
Reiterating that five out of the 21 most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change are here in the region, Maurer said the local communities, especially, women, children, and the elderly would be affected most by the problem exacerbated with war and violence.
""But, we look at some of the most important displacement crisis worldwide is happening in the Horn of Africa. This affects women and children.""
By the way, the elderly who are also living outside of the general production process, are affected heavily, he said.
Emphasizing on the complexity of humanitarian works in the region, the ICRC president has called for coordinated efforts from both humanitarian and development actors to deal with the different situations in the region.
""So, again for humanitarian activities means, we cannot just distribute foods and water; we have to look at schools; kids must not be out of schools for years. We have to look at health systems and health services to be provided for whole communities,"" he noted.
In its statement on Wednesday, ICRC said thousands of people are displaced each day from their homes by climate shocks or violence. Preliminary data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre suggest that, on average, the number of people displaced from their homes each day in 2019 was 3,715 in Ethiopia and 1,860 in Somalia.
The region started 2019 in drought and then experienced floods in May. It then swung back to drought before torrential rains in October and November unleashed the worst floods in decades.

Kenyan farmers have been in a dilemma as planting season nears amid climate change and locust invasion.
NAIROBI, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- About this time a few years ago, George Ambuche, a maize farmer in Kitale of western Kenya, would be busy tilling his land in preparation for the planting season, which began at the onset of the rain season in March.
However, it is about 10 days to March and Ambuche is not bothered about preparing his farm yet. ""Until I see the rains, that is when I will till the land,"" he said on phone on Tuesday.
""Last year, I lost money I had spent on fertilizer, hiring tractors and seeds because I had to replant since the rains delayed. Once bitten, twice shy,"" he added.
His predicament is shared by thousands of farmers across the east African nation as the country grapples with the effects of climate change. In the past, Kenyan farms would have been full of activity about this time of the year.
Tractor owners would now be as busy as bees, moving from one farm to another, ploughing or harrowing the land in readiness for planting maize as they charge at least 2,000 shillings ( about 20 U.S. dollars) per acre.
Not anymore. Only the hard-nosed optimists, who are few amid the climate crisis, are daring to do early ploughing.
A majority of farmers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the unpredictable rains. Last year, instead of March, the rains started in May and lasted for about a month instead of three, according to the Meteorological Department.
And for the second season, which runs from October to December, rains were so heavy that they extended to January 2020, destroying crops.
""The weather has become too erratic that no one is getting it right, not the Meteorological Department, nor the traditional rainmakers. This is because of climate change,"" said Beatrice Macharia of Growth Point, an agro-consultancy.

The unpredictability has left millions of farmers in dilemma as Kenya's agriculture is rain-fed, added Macharia.
""I don't know whether I should plant maize this season or not because the locusts are just next door in Embu and spraying has not helped,"" said Martin Kariuki, a farmer in Nyeri, adding that he will wait and see.
Climate-related pests like fall armyworms and locusts exacerbate the situation for Kenyan farmers.
Kenya is currently grappling with locust invasion, the worst in 70 years, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.
The insects have ravaged crops and vegetation in 18 counties, a majority of them semi-arid.
Efforts to contain them in the last two months have borne little fruit, with the Minister of Agriculture Peter Munya on Monday appealing to Kenyans to be patient as the government steps up aerial and ground spraying.
Chris Kiptoo, Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, noted that Kenya and the entire eastern African region is vulnerable to the vagaries of climate change thus the country must prioritize mitigation measures.
To harvest about twenty 90-kg bags of maize in Kenya's breadbasket regions, it costs between 200 dollars and 300 dollars, according to agriculture think-tank Tegemeo Institute.
This means it costs an average of 15 dollars to produce a bag of maize. Amid slowdown in economic growth, this is money Kenyan farmers are not willing to lose amid the unpredictability of the rains.
With Uganda and Tanzania also struggling with erratic weather and locust invasion, east Africa may be staring at a food crisis.  ■

A swarm of desert locusts invade parts of Mwingi Town in Kitui County, Kenya, Feb. 20, 2020. Extreme weather events due to the climate crisis are becoming the new normal in the Horn of Africa (HoA) as recent heavy rains and cyclonic activity resulted in a desert locust upsurge that has affected countries in the region and beyond, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has stressed. (Xinhua/Zhang Yu)
ADDIS ABABA, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- Extreme weather events due to the climate crisis are becoming the new normal in the Horn of Africa (HoA) as recent heavy rains and cyclonic activity resulted in a desert locust upsurge that has affected countries in the region and beyond, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has stressed.
Noting that climate crisis-inflicted extreme weather events ""are becoming the new normal in the Horn of Africa region,"" the UNOCHA in its latest humanitarian update issued on Thursday stressed that back-to-back droughts and floods in 2019 have led to rising needs and compounded the humanitarian consequences of conflict and violence across countries in the region.
""Just two years after the 2016/2017 drought and one year after flooding in 2018, back-to-back droughts and floods in 2019 have led to rising needs and compounded the humanitarian consequences of conflict and violence in multiple locations,"" the UNOCHA statement read.
According to the UNOCHA, in addition to the loss of lives, livestock and crops, as well as population displacement, the above-normal rains and cyclonic activity in late-2019 and early-2020 have contributed to a desert locust upsurge that has affected countries including Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia.
""Of the 24.1 million severely food insecure people across the Greater Horn of Africa, an estimated 9.75 million are living in areas affected by desert locusts in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia,"" the statement read.
Describing the desert locust as ""the most dangerous migratory pest in the world,"" it also warned that the desert locust is ""expected to continue to breed and spread in the coming months, coinciding with the start of the next planting season.""
It also stressed that ""without urgent effective control measures, the locusts could severely impact the food insecurity of households already struggling to cope with multiple shocks.""
The latest call by the UNOCHA also came a day after the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned over serious food security and livelihoods threat inflicted by ""widespread desert locust infestations and a new generation of breeding in the region as the situation remains extremely alarming in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia.""

** Drought-causing Indian Ocean phenomenon linked to climate ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/13/c_138779570.htm *

CANBERRA, Feb. 13 (Xinhua) -- A climactic phenomenon in the Indian Ocean that causes drought in Australia has been linked to climate change.
In a study published on Thursday, researchers from Australian National University and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) found that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is more likely to be in a positive state as a result of global warming.
The IOD measures sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean. A ""positive"" state is when waters near the Horn of Africa are warmer than average while those near Australia are cooler, resulting in less rainfall and high temperatures.
The research team found that the positive IOD events have become stronger and more frequent since the 1960s.
The Australian drought of 2019, one of the worst in the nation's history, occurred at a time when the IOD was at a record positive, causing flooding in eastern Africa.
""The rain bands are moving away to where the (sea) temperature is maximum,"" Wenju Cai, the director of the Centre for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research at the CSIRO, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).

According to projections produced by Cai, Australia will experience twice as many drought-causing extreme IOD positives if global temperatures warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres makes a special talk on sustainable development and climate change in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Feb. 16, 2020. The climate change is the gravest and most urgent obstacle to the global stability and prosperity, and greater joint efforts made by every country and every community in the world are necessary to deal with the crisis, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said here on Sunday. (Xinhua/Liu Tian)
ISLAMABAD, Feb. 16 (Xinhua) -- The climate change is the gravest and most urgent obstacle to the global stability and prosperity, and greater joint efforts made by every country and every community in the world are necessary to deal with the crisis, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said here on Sunday.
Making a special talk on sustainable development and climate change, Guterres said the climate disruption presents a clear danger worldwide including the locust attack that Pakistan and other countries are suffering. ""Global warming is leading to global swarming.""
""The planet is burning, but too many decision-makers continue to fiddle,"" he said, adding that the global momentum for tackling the climate crisis has unfortunately stalled since the 2015 Paris Agreement.
""It is something I am convinced we can tackle if only we can generate the political will and the unity we need to make a difference,"" the UN chief said, adding that at the climate change conference to be held in Glasgow, governments must deliver the transformational change the world needs and people demand with much stronger ambition.
Besides environmental protection, Guterres also urged the world to step up action to achieve other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which cover the whole spectrum of human progress including healthcare, gender equality, poverty alleviation.
The SDGs are relevant to every nation and every community, and no country can say it has no inequality or problems related to pollution or climate change, he said.
""Today's challenges to sustainable development and human progress do not respect borders. They are not confined to individual nations.""
The UN chief also lauded the measures Pakistan has taken in terms of healthcare, poverty alleviation and environmental protection, but said whether in Pakistan or elsewhere, the pace of change is not yet fast enough.
""In fact, by some estimates, we will only get halfway to our goals at the current pace,"" he said. Everyone can and must make a contribution to facilitate the process toward achieving the SDGs and collaborative actions across borders and sectors are required, he said.
""We are in the battle for our lives. Our sustainable future is at stake, but I firmly believe it is a battle that can be won,"" Guterres said.
The UN chief arrived in Pakistan early Sunday. During his visit in the country from Feb. 16-19, he will also attend an international conference on Afghan refugees and hold talks with Pakistani leaders.

** Feature: Aloe vera offers Kenyans in drylands opportunities amid ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/09/c_138768564.htm *

NAIROBI, Feb. 9 (Xinhua) -- The green plant with some tiny spikes on the side of the leaves is scattered on a patched land at Makutano in Machakos, south of Kenya's capital Nairobi.
When there was a long dry spell in Kenya last year, the aloe vera plants were left standing as others dried up.
The recent rains have given the other plants a lifeline and the aloe vera too, but not as much as the desert plants thrives during dry periods. Initially, the aloe vera was a wild plant, with little benefits for Makutano residents and the rest in Kenya's drylands.
It would grow, age and die after many years on its own without much interference from residents or animals.
A few, however, who knew its value would harvest one or two leaves and use them to make concoctions for treating various ailments.
But that was before buyers from the capital Nairobi, some foreigners started to visit the area in search of the plant's leaves.
The drought-tolerant plant that grows naturally in many arid and semi-arid areas across Kenya, has turned to be the new moneymaker in the regions.
The crop is lifting many households out of poverty and food insecurity as citizens plant the crop for cash.
""In Makutano, we grow mainly the Aloe barbadensis variety,"" Collins Nzeli, a retired military man, who now grows 3,000 aloe plants, said in a recent interview.
Nzeli noted that the plant has good commercial value as one mature leaf weighs at least a kilogram.
""You get over a tonne of leaves from plants on about quarter-acre which makes the business good,"" he said.
Dennis Achebi of Herbal Garden, one of the buyers and processors of aloe vera from different parts of Kenya, said one acre of aloe vera offers up to five tonnes of leaves, making it a profitable arid crop.
Achebi noted that the once wild plant is putting money in the hands of farmers, thanks to increased interest in the crop due to its medicinal value.
""As climate change ravages especially dry areas, farmers can readily rely on aloe vera to make money. When it rains, it takes in as much water as possible, and then uses it during the dry period. It survives in all arid and semi-arid areas,"" he said, adding the crop is now farmed like any other.
The aloe vera plant is versatile with its sap used as an ingredient in many products in different industries, from soap making to producing medicine.
Other uses include making juices, soaps, herbal remedies, teas, detergents, food supplements and jelly oils.
The leaves are the most sought after parts of the plant, and they are normally crushed and the medicinal sap extracted.
Apart from the leaves, farmers also sell aloe vera sprouts to those who want to start farming of the crop commercially.
Beatrice Macharia of Growth Point noted that aloe vera has grown in many arid areas naturally but few knew its commercial value.
She said that as climate change hits many dry areas, aloe vera offers residents income as it is increasingly harder to grow other food crops.

** Natural groundwater contaminant major threat to drinking supplies ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/10/c_138863239.htm *

SYDNEY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- More than half of the world's population faces a major threat to drinking water quality and availability because climate change and urbanization are set to cause increases in groundwater contaminants, according to latest Australian research.
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a naturally occurring component of groundwater, but the higher its concentration, the more difficult and expensive it is to make groundwater drinkable, according to a University of New South Wales statement on Tuesday.
The study examined a global dataset of more than 9,400 published and unpublished groundwater DOC concentrations from aquifers in 32 countries across six continents, forecasting elevated DOC levels ""because of projected changes in temperature and rainfall due to climate change, as well as increased urbanization,"" it said.
""We identified groundwater DOC concentration increases of up to 45 percent, largely because of increased temperatures in the wettest quarter of the year - for example, in a number of southeastern states in the United States,"" university researcher and study lead author Liza McDonough said.
""Generally, we expect urbanization to increase groundwater DOC concentrations by up to 19 percent, compared to agricultural or natural land use, likely as the result of contamination - for example, through leaking septic and sewer systems.""
The study, published in scientific journal Nature Communications, found four major contributing factors to groundwater DOC levels: climate, land use, inorganic chemistry and aquifer age.
Increased groundwater DOC, naturally occurring or due to contamination, also posed a threat to human health, McDonough said.
""Groundwater is Earth's largest source of freshwater and provides essential drinking water for more than 50 percent of the world's population,"" she said.
""But, because most health impacts caused by DOC are related to the formation of by-products of water treatment chlorination and depend on concentrations of other water chemical parameters, the World Health Organization and many countries - including Australia - do not regulate DOC concentrations in drinking water directly.""
McDonough said that while DOC is a naturally occurring, key element of groundwater, it could combine with, and transport, potentially dangerous heavy metals otherwise bound to rocks and sediment where groundwater occurs.
""This is a concern when, for example, more than 100,000 lifetime cancer cases in the United States alone can be attributed to drinking water contaminants,"" she said.
McDonough said she looked forward to conducting further research to determine the best water treatment options for areas where groundwater DOC concentrations are anticipated to increase.
""Our next step is to investigate how the character of DOC changes when you have different aquifer minerals, because some types of organic matter can stick to certain mineral surfaces and ultimately reduce this type of organic matter remaining in the water,"" she said.
""This will help provide guidance on the most suitable water treatment options in areas where DOC concentrations are expected to increase.""

** ""Heart of India"" aims to boost tourism riding on highest tiger headcount **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/04/c_138841938.htm *




India is home to nearly 75 percent of the world's tiger population.
To protect the endangered tigers and other wild animals, India's central Madhya Pradesh state proposes to boost wildlife tourism, and combat the threats of climate change and global warming.
NEW DELHI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- As the World Wildlife Day falls on Tuesday, India's central state of Madhya Pradesh, better known as the ""Heart of India,"" is aiming to boost tourism banking on its tigers.
The state remains home to the largest number of tigers, leopards, vultures in the country. Over the years the state has made relentless efforts to increase the population of the highly endangered ""Barasingha,"" a hard ground swamp deer, and has come a long way in protecting the natural order and habitat for animals.
It also boasts the largest number of tigers, 526, out of the country's total headcount of 3,000 and continues to leave no stone unturned to ensure protection of wildlife. It also aims at protecting the rich diversity of wildlife species, ecosystems and ecosystem services.
India is home to nearly 75 percent of the world's tiger population. The country has committed to doubling the number of tigers in the next two years.
Also described as the ""Wildlife State of India,"" Madhya Pradesh has as many as 11 national parks and 24 wildlife sanctuaries, besides six tiger reserves which are a part of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
Across India there are a total of 50 tiger reserves which are governed by Project Tiger, a dedicated programme for tiger conservation administered by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).

Hailing the state government's moves for wildlife conservation, Pushpraj Singh, an environmentalist and conservationist from the state's Rewa district, suggests that the state could attract a large number of tourists, both from home and abroad, if more focus was laid on promoting activities like white tiger safari such as the one at the Mukundpur White Tiger Safari and Zoo.
According to Singh, a former member of the country's Wildlife Board, Madhya Pradesh's tourism potential was still untapped, and that a few concrete steps like improving connectivity infrastructure could do wonders.
Over two decades ago he set up a trust for the protection of wildlife and environment, along with the welfare of the local tribesmen.
Madhya Pradesh Tourism Secretary Faiz Ahmed Kidwai said that on the occasion of the World Wildlife Day the state reiterates its focus on wildlife tourism, and combating threats of climate change and global warming through wild-life conservation.
""It focuses on creating favorable conditions for the conservation of tigers especially the endangered Bengal Tiger and the rare White Tiger. As the World Wildlife Day approaches on March 3, we would like to reiterate our commitment to protecting endangered wildlife, specially tigers through a scientific, planned and people-centric approach with strict enforcement guidelines and team support,"" he said.
About the idea of promoting white tiger safari, Kidwai said that within the state there were as many as nine white tigers, which remain a key attraction for tourists. ""But these white tigers are not part of the tiger census as these are not in the wild, but in captivity,"" he added.
According to him, the first white tiger Mohan, considered as the forefather of all the white tigers, was found in Madhya Pradesh only. ""We recently launched a new logo for Sanjay Tiger Reserve which bears the facial marks of Mohan with the characteristic blue eyes,"" he said.
White tigers are said to be a mutant variety of the yellow tiger. They have a gene which is the outcome of a mutation process and gives the yellow tiger a white color skin and blue eyes. The white tiger is not a different sub species, but very much a part of the Royal Bengal Tiger family.■

** Australian summers growing longer due to climate change: report ... **

* http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/02/c_138834104.htm *

CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian summers have grown 31 days longer compared to the mid-twentieth century benchmark, a new analysis has found.
Research published by the Australia Institute on Monday revealed that summers are on average 31 days longer and winters 21 days shorter than in the 1950s and 60s.
The team studied Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) data from 70 stations around Australia from between 1999 and 2018 and compared it to records from 1950 to 1969, concluding that global warming has significantly changed Australia's seasons.
""If summer feels like it's getting longer and longer, it's because it actually is, especially if you're an older Australian,"" Richie Merzian, the director of the Climate and Energy Program at the institute, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
""Those average summer temperatures are starting a lot earlier and they're finishing a lot later, so summers have become twice as long as winters in the last five years.""
Melbourne was experiencing an additional 38 days of summer, the biggest growth of any capital city, and 19 fewer days of winter compared to the 1950s and 1960s.
Canberra, the national capital, had 35 fewer days of winter and 31 more summer days.
The trend of longer summers was even more pronounced in regional areas and could have significant effects including longer bushfire seasons.
""Extended summers will have significant impacts on Australia's tourism, construction and mining sectors, as well as impacting the everyday lives of Australians. When it comes to agriculture, extended summers can damage crops and exhaust livestock,"" said Merzian.

As well as low reproductive rates and loss of habitat through development, the ongoing threat posed by Australia's recent bushfires and climate change puts koala's future at significant risk.
SYDNEY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of Australia's recent bushfire crisis, a new scientific study is calling for one of the country's most beloved animals -- the koala -- to officially be reclassified as endangered.
Examining a period of 15 weeks from Oct. 1, 2019 to Jan. 10, 2020, the report commissioned by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and prepared by the research group Biolink, conservatively estimated that around 5,000 koalas, or 12 percent of the population in New South Wales (NSW) State were killed as a direct result of the bushfires.
But while some koalas may have escaped the flames, IFAW wildlife campaigner Josey Sharrad told the Australian Associated Press on Thursday, the figures do not include the ongoing losses which are expected due to habitat destruction.
""The surviving koalas have nowhere to go,"" she said. ""We want them to have breathing space to recover because they've been hit so hard.""
""The prolonged drought, excess land clearing, habitat loss and now the fires - it's hit at the heart of so many significant koala populations.""

With more research to be completed covering the period to Feb. 10, 2020, the report found that the iconic marsupials are facing ""serious challenges"" when it comes to their long-term survival.
As well as low reproductive rates and loss of habitat through development, the ongoing threat posed by bushfires and climate change puts the specie's future at significant risk.
""The consequence of more frequent fires is that remaining koala populations are simply not able to recover from one fire event before being subjected to another,"" Sharrad said. ""These fires have been a game changer.""
""Everything needs to be re-thought. They're literally fighting for their survival.""
In response, the NSW state government is reported to be considering an emergency endangered species listing, meaning there will be greater funding for conservation available and increased restrictions on land clearing near koala habitat. ■

Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade, says a report of the World Meteorological Organization.
UNITED NATIONS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The decade of 2010-2019 was the warmest on record, and 2019 was the second-warmest year ever, according to a report of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
It finds that 2015-2019 are the five warmest consecutive years on record.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks at the launch of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019, at the UN headquarters in New York, on March 10, 2020. (Xinhua/Xie E)
Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade, according to the WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019, which was jointly launched on Tuesday by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and WMO chief Petteri Taalas at the UN Headquarters in New York.
2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1 degrees Celcius above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Nino event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend, according to the report.
Without the role of El Nino in 2016, 2019 would have been the hottest year on record, said Taalas.

(Xinhua/Xie E)
Guterres said that 2020 is a pivotal year for climate action in the context of the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland.
""We have no time to lose if we are to avert climate catastrophe,"" he said. ""We have to aim high at the next climate conference in Glasgow in November. We need all countries to demonstrate that we can achieve emissions reductions of 45 percent from 2010 levels this decade, and that we will reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. And we know this is the only way to limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius."" (Video reporter: Xie E)■

              HOME >> OPINION    China-South Pacific ties maintain ‘sense of justice,’ friendship    By Zhai Kun Source:Global Times Published: 2019/10/27 22:18:40           Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua attends the opening ceremony and delivers a congratulatory message from Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 3rd China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum in Apia, Samoa, on October 21. Photo: Xinhua The third China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum was held on October 21 in Apia, the capital city of Samoa. The two sides explored more cooperation opportunities in a variety of fields including infrastructure, trade, environmental protection, agriculture and tourism. Unsurprisingly, some Western media and observers attempted to hype up ""debt-trap diplomacy."" Lowy Institute, an independent think tank based in Sydney, issued a report entitled ""Ocean of debt? Belt and Road and debt diplomacy in the Pacific"" on the same day the forum was held, saying ""important questions about the risk of debt problems in less-developed countries"" have been raised because of their cooperation with China, adding ""the risks are especially acute for the small and fragile economies of the Pacific."" This reflects Australia's vigilance against China as well as its consistent condescending arrogant attitude toward Pacific island countries. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) in November 2018, met with Pacific island leaders and promoted bilateral relations with PNG to a new comprehensive strategic partnership featuring mutual respect and common development. Under the guidance, ties between China and Pacific island countries have reached substantial progress in 2019. On April 1, the 2019 Year of Tourism for China and Pacific Island Countries was launched in Apia. In September, the Solomon Islands and Kiribati ended their ""diplomatic"" relations with Taiwan and respectively established and restored ties with the Chinese mainland. China and Pacific island countries have maintained close communication and cooperation on issues such as climate change and sustainable development. It is no exaggeration to say that 2019 is the year of China-South Pacific ties in terms of China's diplomacy. Pacific island countries are small but smart. They are fully capable of exploring and finding a development path that suits them. The cooperative concept of mutual respect and common development is in line with their wish when it comes to foreign relations. Over the past decade, China has become the largest export destination for many of the Pacific island countries given their economic complementarities. Take the Solomon Islands. ""According to the World Bank, in 2017, the Solomon Islands exported $554.8 million worth of commodities, or two-thirds of its total exports, to China,"" reported The Diplomat on October 18. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries will undoubtedly further boost their bilateral trade and the Chinese market is apparently attractive to island countries, which are seeking independent development. Under the framework of South-South cooperation and the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has provided development assistance within its power to the islands as well as experiences including ""to get rich, build roads first."" In addition to infrastructural collaboration, China has also strengthened cooperation with the island countries in agricultural technologies, introducing the techniques of planting fungus, bamboo and other vegetables. The China scholarship program, Confucius Institutes and medical services in the region have further improved people-to-people connections between China and these Pacific island countries. Improving friendly ties with China is the choice of people from Pacific island countries. China has made its efforts to win those countries' respect. For instance, on issues of climate change and sustainable development, China has taken effective actions, which echo the concerns of the island countries. When facing Western countries, including Australia's hype that China is a geostrategic competitor, leaders from Pacific island countries have spoken out from a sense of justice. In August, Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Malielegaoi said that island countries won't line up with Australia and the US against China, declaring ""their enemies are not our enemies,"" The Australian reported. Malielegaoi added that ""[The Pacific's] only interest is to provide the kind of modern living, decent kind of modern living, of our people,"" and if countries ""against China"" did not approve of Beijing's influence in the region ""they should come in and provide the assistance that China is providing."" When PNG's Prime Minister James Marape visited Australia in July and was asked questions about China, Marape articulated that PNG's overall position on foreign policy is being ""friends to all and enemies to none."" Fiji's Parliament Speaker Ratu Epeli Nailatikau hailed the BRI in March, saying that many countries will benefit from this great initiative. Australia has been the largest donor in the Pacific islands region. It is geographically close to them with wide and deep social connections. Other countries are no match for these advantages. However, Australia should respect the countries' own choices, instead of being arrogant on their decisions and moves. Canberra should accept and be happy about the fact that Pacific island countries will have a wider development path and more opportunities, rather than completely depending on Australia's assistance. Australia should not keep holding the countries as its own backyard.

Photo: VCG China's cooperation with Pacific island countries centers on development and mutual benefit rather than geopolitical strategic ambition or competition with the US, said Chinese experts on Monday. Some from the West have been questioning the sustainability of the cooperation and China's intention, as China and the island nations held an economic development forum. The 3rd China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum was launched on Monday in Samoa's capital city of Apia. Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the event. Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, who attended the forum's opening ceremony on Monday, read the letter at the forum, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Xi stressed that holding the 3rd forum is an important consensus reached between him and leaders of the Pacific island countries, saying he hopes the two sides make full use of this important platform to strengthen dialogue, exchanges and cooperation for greater progress in bilateral cooperation. In his trip to Samoa, Hu also met officials of 10 Pacific island countries with diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, and they discussed the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), trade, investment, infrastructure, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism and climate change, and also signed relevant cooperation documents. China signed as many as seven new agreements with Samoa ahead of the event, covering education, e-commerce, investment, infrastructure and agriculture. ABC reported Monday. Delegates from some 200  companies attended Samoa event, including e-commerce giant Alibaba, the Samoa News reported. Groundless concern While cooperation between China and Pacific island countries improves, Western media and institutions raised their concerns. ""Countries that establish closer ties to China primarily out of the hope or expectation that such a step will stimulate economic growth and infrastructure development often find themselves worse off in the long run,"" US Vice President Mike Pence said, Reuters reported in September. Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that this kind of ""concern"" is truly strange, because it is totally based on mind-set of geopolitical competition and the US Indo-Pacific strategy, but never asks what the Pacific island countries really want and need. Yu Lei, chief research fellow at the research center for Pacific island countries of Liaocheng University, said that ""Even now, the economic and energy lifeblood of the Solomon Islands is still in the hands of Western countries such as Australia, New Zealand, France and the UK"" ""China, on the other hand, will cooperate with the Solomon Islands to develop local resources in a protective and sustainable way which will benefit local people and generate taxes for their country,"" Yu said. More importantly, this could reduce the island country's reliance on the West, Li noted. ""The US has showed the world how untrustworthy it could be on the climate change issue, but Pacific states are the ones who worry about global warming the most,"" Li said. Debt and development The Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, released a report  on Monday which said that the BRI has exposed the issue of unsustainable debt risk for less-developed countries, in particular for small and fragile economies in the Pacific. Li said small countries in the region are less developed. But if everyone treats them as a risk then these countries will never have a chance to develop, even they have the potential in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and tourism. When China cooperated with African countries, similar voices also emerged, but China has the experience and ability to fulfill its plan and benefit its partners, so we are confident, Li noted.

(Xinhua/Guo Lei)  At the 3rd China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum held Monday here, the capital city of Pacific island country Samoa, the participating countries reiterated their determination to step up win-win cooperation with China in various fields. At the forum, with the signing of the ""China-Pacific Island Countries Program of Action on Economic Development and Cooperation,"" China stressed again that its support the regional countries will be catered to their needs. ""TEACH A MAN TO FISH""  As a famous Chinese proverb goes -- ""give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."" This is the approach of China's cooperation with the island countries of the Pacific island. It means expanding their capacity and strengthening development sustainability. The China-Samoa Agricultural Technical Aid Project, a bilateral cooperation project launched in 2010 to instruct Samoan farmers in agricultural techniques and technologies, has enabled locals to raise productivity and improve incomes. John Maposua, a farmer from the Aleasa village in Apia, has benefited from the project. ""I'm a farmer here for 30 years. Previously I kept eggplants and could hardly sell them for a good price. Now using seeds from Chinese experts, my farm produce is in great demand by restaurants in Apia,"" he told Xinhua on Sunday. Maposua has built two tunnel houses and a drip irrigation system to create an all-year growing season. His greenhouses managed to generate revenues over 11,000 Samoan tala (about 4,100 US dollars) during the first six months after being put into use. As the project increases agricultural productivity, Samoa has eased the domestic vegetable shortage, the project's leader Liu Zhiwen recalled, adding that he feels proud of such achievements. Apart from agriculture, tourism is also a pillar industry for Pacific island countries. The cooperation with China brings an increasing number of tourists and thus injects new vitality into the region. Chris Cocker, CEO of the South Pacific Tourism Organization (SPTO), an intergovernmental tourism organization in South Pacific, told Xinhua ""there are a growing number of Pacific countries, including SPTO members, exploring the Chinese outbound market as a potential source market."" Cocker says the number of the Chinese tourists to Pacific island countries grew by an average of 13.36 percent over the past five years. With the official launch of the China-Pacific Tourism Year 2019, the number of Chinese visitors is expected to grow more rapidly.

(Xinhua/Guo Lei)  JOINT ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE Boasting a crystal clear ocean and unique landscapes, Pacific island countries are a paradise for nature lovers. However, these low-lying islands share a deep-rooted fear -- the rising sea levels due to climate change. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the forum, Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said tackling climate change is critical to Pacific island countries facing a global warming threat. In his view, China is not only a heavyweight partner in economic and trade cooperation, but also an important ally in environmental protection. Meg Taylor, secretary-general of the Pacific Islands Forum, said that climate change is a big threat for the security and well-being of the region, and China is an ally in coping with the problem. She added China has made significant progress in renewable energy development, like solar and wind energy. In the South Pacific region, China has undertaken a number of projects to preserve the environment. For example, China has assisted several countries, including Samoa, with crop-livestock-biogas recycling schemes to reduce agricultural pollution and carbon emissions. In addition, China has also introduced its Juncao grass technology to Fiji and Papua New Guinea. The special Chinese grass can help increase income through low-cost mushroom cultivation, and minimize soil erosion by providing a new source of cattle feed other than pasture grass.

(Xinhua/Guo Lei)  As the Pacific island countries are located on the geographic extension of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road , the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) acts as a new platform for cooperation between China and the countries. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce , China's combined trade volume with eight Pacific island countries reached 4.32 billion dollars in 2018, growing over 25 percent year-on-year. Currently, China is the biggest trading partner and export market for the Solomon Islands, second largest trading partner for Papua New Guinea and Fiji, and third largest trading partner for Samoa. China's total investment volume to the island countries amounted to 4.53 billion dollars. Projects of the two sides reached a total value of over 15 billion dollars, and created around 15,000 jobs for locals. Francois Martel, secretary general of the Fiji-based Pacific Islands Development Forum, told Xinhua that the BRI is a great engine to push forward social and economic development for Pacific island countries. China, as the largest developing country in the world, has not only developed itself, but also been helping others like the Pacific island countries, Martel said. ""Over the past several years, you can see China has shown respect to the island countries and has invested a lot and has provided a lot of assistance to this region,"" he said. ""What China has done in this region is mutually beneficial and win-win.""

** HK rioters' acts show violence quotient highest in the world - Global ... **

              HOME >> OPINION    HK rioters’ acts show violence quotient highest in the world    By Adam Garrie Source:Global Times Published: 2019/10/23 19:28:40           The surrounding roads are closed as an Extinction Rebellion protester demonstrates on the scaffolding surrounding the Elizabeth Tower, also known as the Big Ben, in London, Britain, on October 18. Photo: Xinhua For most ordinary Londoners, the self-described climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion is irksome with disruptive provocateurs who are exploiting genuine concerns about long-term climate impact in order to bring the British capital to a halt. It has already been reported that the group's provocations have delayed the arrival of a cancer patient to a prominent London hospital. An even more recent provocation during which protesters climbed atop a train, only ended when working-class commuters dragged the visibly well-off men from the top of the train. After being dragged away, the provocateurs were restrained by an angry crowd desperate to go to work and carry on with their lives. But this is not where the controversy ends. The group also aims to subvert the British Constitution by creating a so-called citizens' assembly whose power would apparently reign supreme over the Parliament and head of state. Beyond this, the group's cofounder Roger Hallam has said, ""We are not just sending out emails and asking for donations. We are going to force the governments to act. And if they don't, we will bring them down and create a democracy fit for purpose… and yes, some may die in the process."" This threat should be taken very seriously. Groups like the Islamic State have often used similar language to promote their illegal cause and there is no reason why Hallam's words should be taken any less seriously. While English streets are often home to legal peaceful protests, Extinction Rebellion is something very different. Members of the radical group admit this themselves. Extinction Rebellion member Sarah Lunnon recently appeared on British radio where she stated that the group's whole philosophy ""is to disrupt."" She later admitted that some protesters are remunerated for their disruptive activities although she clammed up when asked to explain the source of such funds. If one lives in Hong Kong, there is little doubt that much of what is occurring in London is familiar. In Hong Kong, riots continue to plague the streets, open squares, train stations and private businesses. What began as a controversial though mostly peaceful protest against a specific change to judicial policy has now grown into an all-out assault on the law-abiding people and social norms of Hong Kong. In spite of rioters in Hong Kong placing police lives in danger, thus far, the response from the authorities has been noticeably restrained. This is especially true when compared with the treatment of nationalist Yellow Vest protesters by French police and also the treatment of Catalan independence protesters by Spanish police. In Britain, police have traditionally been far less aggressive than in continental Europe, but even so, after a week and a half of Extinction Rebellion erecting encampments in central London thoroughfares, police ultimately cleared the area and made arrests of those who would not peacefully disperse. And yet, Hong Kong's rioters have shown a propensity for violence that has thus far outdone protesters in the UK, France or Spain. It is the duty of the police to protect civilians and property against violence by any criminal organization. This is distinct from overseeing a peaceful protest. Now after months of rioting, there is hardly any doubt that gangsterism on the streets of Hong Kong would not and should not be tolerated anywhere. Lawlessness tends to beget lawlessness and in the case of Hong Kong ordinary people are clearly getting fed up. Beyond this, the vandalism against legislative chambers, police stations and the burning of the national flag makes it perfectly clear that the Hong Kong riot ers are not looking to improve their country. Instead, it has become self-evident that they are looking to destroy their country. In London, working-class people openly took charge against visibly wealthy Extinction Rebellion protesters because unlike the protesters, they had to reach their workplaces. In Hong Kong, business, workers and the international reputation of the city are being ravaged by the actions of the rioters. Perhaps it will not be long until the ordinary people of Hong Kong also become exhausted by the violence perpetrated by the provocateurs and begin to take matters in their hands. The lessons from London and Hong Kong are that provocations, violence and disruptions are acts of lawlessness and vandalism which can never have any legitimate purpose. In this sense, it would be helpful if all members of the international community respected the internal law and order of all countries. Sadly, this has not been the case in Hong Kong as some in Western countries have sided not with the defenders of law and peace but with criminals and vandals. It would be helpful if upon reflection, these double standards could give way to consistent and rational thinking.

** Climate change comes with invasive species - Global Times **

* http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1171582.shtml *

              HOME >> WORLD    Climate change comes with invasive species    Source:AFP Published: 2019/11/28 20:03:40        Melting ice will introduce non-indigenous flora and fauna to South Pole     A group of penguins are seen in this photo taken from aboard China's polar icebreaker Xuelong 2 in Antarctica water on Nov. 19, 2019. China's icebreakers Xuelong 2 and Xuelong are carring out the country's 36th Antarctic expedition. (Xinhua/Liu Shiping) In the tiny part of Antarctica where the snow melts in springtime, mosses, lichens and grasses grow alongside flies, mites and colonies of micro-organisms that have fed and reproduced for millions of years. The rich biodiversity is preserved by an ancient equilibrium of extreme cold and the isolation of a land mass surrounded by powerful ocean currents. But scientists argue in a report published Wednesday that climate change will make it easier for invasive species to establish themselves, even though the continent is warming at a slower pace than other parts of the planet. ""Climate change both reduces the barrier to getting in, so it makes it less stressful ... And it reduces the problems of establishing,"" said British Antarctic Survey expert Peter Convey, who co-authored the research published in ""­Science Advances."" Antarctica is home to species that can gather in greater densities than those seen in temperate or tropical climates, said Convey, pointing to microscopic arthropods known as Collembola, a million of which can squeeze into a square meter. Thousands of researchers and 50,000 tourists who visit the remote continent every year risk upsetting this balance, however, by bringing plant and insect life with them. One type of grass, Poa annua, has already managed to carve out a beachhead on some islands, while humans have brought with them two species of fly. Some species do manage to fly in or arrive by other natural means from the tip of South America some 1,000 kilometers away, but these migrants do not manage to establish themselves permanently. ""The bottom line is that humans bring in 99 percent of [invasive species] and they far outweigh any natural process,"" said Convey, who can name around 100 that have come in the past two centuries. At the current rate of warming, the area of ice-free land in the Antarctic peninsula, in the west, is set to rise by 300 percent in the next century. That means any invasive species will have a lot more land to colonize, said the scientist. With more land and more water available thanks to melting ice, life is likely to explode and competition for resources between species will intensify. Grasses will fight against mosses, local species of fly will face off against invaders. The exact effect is difficult to predict precisely. The Antarctic Treaty of 1959 provides for the protection of the continent's environment. And while the current debate focuses on melting ice, the authors of Wednesday's report warn that other human activities ""particularly those of historical marine exploitation, land use change, and biological invasions, are, in reality, likely to [continue to] have far greater immediate impacts on Antarctic ecosystems than climate change per se.""

** Amid climate worries, Mexico doubles down on fossil fuels - Global ... **

* http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1168792.shtml *

              HOME >> WORLD    Amid climate worries, Mexico doubles down on fossil fuels    Source:Reuters Published: 2019/11/3 17:38:39         On the same September day that activist Greta Thurnberg gave a fiery speech in New York demanding world leaders tackle climate change, Mexico's president was touting achievements of a wholly different kind: increasing funding for oil production.   People await a load of gasoline at a gas station in the city of Morelia, Michoacan State, Mexico on January 9. The strategy against fuel theft in Mexico must have an emergency plan to address the shortage in several states, which can lead to a ""crisis,"" said the President of the Business Coordinating Council (CCE), Juan Pablo Castanon. Photo: IC ""We're investing in refineries. It hasn't been done for a long time,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters at a news conference in Mexico City. ""What was invested this year is going to be repeated next year,"" promised Lopez Obrador, noting that the government had already funneled more than 12 billion pesos ($600 million) towards revamping oil production. The leftist leader, who was elected in a landslide last July, has framed the investment as a way to wean Mexico off its dependency on foreign energy supplies, as well as fueling economic development through increased oil production. But at a time when countries are facing mounting pressure to curb emissions and stave off threats from a warming climate, environmental experts say the Mexican government is moving in the wrong direction. ""While Mexico should be abandoning [oil] production, they're rehabilitating refineries … under a logic of national sovereignty,"" said Leon Avila, a professor of sustainable development at the Intercultural University of Chiapas. ""It's an archaic perspective, based on production in the 70s during the oil boom, and they think they can do the same thing - when really we're in another context,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. On Monday, Mexico's government announced it would expand the rules of its ""clean energy certificates"" (CEL) program to make them available to older hydroelectric plants operated by state utility company CFE. The program previously applied only to new projects, creating an incentive for local and foreign firms to invest in green energy. The CEL-certified energy can be sold to big companies that are required to obtain a percentage of their electricity from clean sources. But in a statement on Tuesday, CFE director general Manuel Bartlett Diaz said that, in line with the president's vision for energy sovereignty, there was ""no reason to subsidize private [electricity] generating companies."" Industry leaders and environmental experts said the move weakens incentives for renewable energy investment, and risks Mexico's compliance with the 2015 Paris Agreement to fight climate change. The Mexican CCE business council said on Tuesday that the change could jeopardize up to $9 billion in foreign and local clean energy investments tied to the original CEL rules. ""The decision detracts from the only mechanism considered by law to drive Mexico's energy transition and meet the mandatory national clean energy adoption goals,"" the CCE said in a statement. More oil, less poverty? The Lopez Obrador administration has emphasized its commitment to tackle climate change and adhere to the Paris accord. At a UN climate conference last December, Sergio Sanchez, then undersecretary for environmental protection, said the government would implement ""concrete policies and actions focused both on reducing emissions and adapting to climate change."" The Mexican senate last week also called on the federal government to declare a ""climate emergency"" and take necessary steps to address climate threats. Those can range from wilder weather and rising seas to more crop-killing droughts that can drive worsening poverty and migration. But at a press conference the following day, the president shied away from recognizing climate change as a crisis. ""We have already considered a series of measures to face the climate change phenomenon in the Development Plan,"" Lopez Obrador said. But the president's description of the plan - listing conservation efforts but omitting any policies to reduce emissions - irked environmentalists. ""There is a lack of understanding for the climate crisis we are confronting,"" said Claudia Campero from the Mexican Alliance Against Fracking, an advocacy group. According to Avila, the university professor, the president has prioritized ending Mexico's entrenched poverty but is using oil as the primary engine to drive prosperity. ""He should care about climate change, but between climate change and going down in history for ending poverty... well obviously he prefers that,"" Avila said. Among Lopez Obrador's most important projects is the construction of a new oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco. The project is set to cost $8 billion, and the government says it would generate up to 23,000 jobs. But besides boosting Mexico's carbon footprint, the refinery, at a coastal site, is vulnerable to climate threats, environmental experts said. Local media reported this week that the property had flooded due to heavy rains. More cash for oil and gas Environmentalists also point with concern to the government's proposed 2020 budget, which would see fossil fuel funding continue to increase. Under the proposal, the energy ministry's budget would jump more than 70 percent compared to last year, to 48.5 billion pesos, following a budget increase this year of over 900 percent compared to 2018. According to an analysis of the budget published in September by a coalition of environmental groups, 96 percent of the money is intended to support oil and natural gas related projects. ""There is no room for more development of fossil fuel extraction,"" said Campero, the fracking opponent. ""(But) that's far from being the vision of this government."" The budget does include about 56 billion pesos for ""adaptation and mitigation of the effects of climate change,"" but of this, 70 percent is being set aside for transporting natural gas, a somewhat cleaner fossil fuel, Campero said. A spokeswoman for the Mexican environment ministry did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Conspicuously absent from the budget, advocates say, is funding for expanding renewables, despite the country's potential to adopt clean energy. According to a 2017 study from the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, which focuses on promoting democracy and social programs, 80 percent of Mexico's energy currently comes from fossil fuels. But the country's landscape and weather conditions mean it could supply its electricity needs entirely from renewable sources, the study noted. The Lopez Obrador administration has appeared reticent to capitalize on this potential, however. In January, the government cancelled a public auction for companies to bid on clean energy contracts. Mexico's 2020 budget is awaiting final approval by congress this month.

              HOME >> CHINA    Chinese experts disagree with sea level threat to wipe out Shanghai by 2050    By Ji Yuqiao Source:Global Times Published: 2019/10/31 22:33:40           Totally 100,000 postcards with messages against climate change on the Jungfraufirn, the upper part of Europe's longest glacier Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland on November 16, 2018 Photo: VCG New research shows that sea levels are rising faster than expected, and by 2050, some of the greatest coastal cities, including Shanghai, will be wiped out. But some Chinese experts said the rise is not as fast, though they admitted global warming poses a huge challenge. The Climate Central in New Jersey, the US published a new prediction on Tuesday, saying that through a more accurate way of calculating land elevation based on satellite readings, the center of East China's Shanghai and other great coastal cities in the world such as such as Mumbai and Bangkok will be under water at high tide by mid-century. In Shanghai, water threatens to consume the heart of the city and many other cities around it, according to a New York Times report. A map in the research shows the old and new projections for 2050 for Shanghai. The city's center becomes deep blue in the new projection, which means it will be below the high-tide line. The research also said that a previous prediction was far too optimistic, and that southern Vietnam will disappear by 2050, where more than 20 million people, almost a fourth of the country's population, currently live. ""The sea level is not rising that fast,"" Zhang Zhiqiang, a deputy director of the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, told the Global Times on Thursday. According to China's third national assessment of climate change published in 2015, China's coastal sea levels rose at a rate of 2.9 millimeters per year from 1980 to 2012. The fourth assessment is under way. Chinese experts also confirmed that rising sea levels would pose a huge threat to coastal cities if the global warming situation does not improve. Bai Yunwen, policy director of Beijing-based nongovernmental organization Greenovation Hub, told the Global Times that regardless of how fast Shanghai or other coastal cities will be wiped out by rising sea levels, cities should be ready to deal with climate change. ""Urban planning should be improved to prevent floods,"" Bai said. ""The government also needs to consider how to ensure fresh water supply when the city sees rising sea levels."" Bai noted that no country should ignore global warming and the disasters it causes. ""All countries need to deal with global warming, especially with   carbon emissions, such as the US.""

** China-Japan ties shouldn't be subject to US' whims - Global Times **

* http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1169964.shtml *

              HOME >> OPINION , WORLD    China-Japan ties shouldn’t be subject to US’ whims    By Zhu Feng Source:Global Times Published: 2019/11/13 22:28:41           Photo: VCG Relations between China and Japan have seen an uptick since the China-Japan-South Korea Trilateral Summit in Tokyo in 2018. The two countries agreed in principle to Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to Japan next spring at the invitation of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The exchange visits of the leaders come after years of fraught ties. Although China-Japan relations are on the way to recover from their lowest point, they still need time to reach a certain stage where ties can be considered satisfactory Global politics and economy are passing through a flux unseen in a century: the fragmentation of the liberal international order, resurgence of trade unilateralism and protectionism, and global climate change. Whether China and Japan as the second and third largest economies in the world can strengthen cooperation and share responsibilities in this new wave of ""great changes"" will have a significant impact on the well being of the people of the two countries and their national standing in the global power matrix. Bilateral economic and social ties have demonstrated unprecedented vitality. As of 2018, bilateral trade had exceeded $300 billion and the number of personnel exchanges had reached almost 12 million. The two have gradually become indispensable partners for the dynamism of the value chains of medium and high-end manufacturing and technological innovation. The trade war on China unilaterally launched by the Trump administration has begun to significantly drag down the Japanese economy. According to the Ministry of Finance of Japan, Japan's goods trade recorded a deficit of 847.99 billion yen ($7.81 billion) for the first half of fiscal 2019 (April to September), marking the second consecutive half-year period in red. Today, China-Japan relations rest on interdependence. Relations have continued to warm since 2019. Tokyo is not willing to do US bidding in economy and trade, but continues to encourage Japanese enterprises to increase investment in China. However, the structural constraints between the two Asian powers still exist. The 2019 white paper issued by Japan's Defense Ministry in September clearly defined China as the main security threat. Moreover, the negative perception of China in Japan hasn't significantly diminished. According to a poll by the Japanese think tank ""Genron NPO"" released on October 24, 44.8 percent Japanese considered relations with China ""bad,"" with a 6-point rise from 2018. The improvement in ties requires more effort and adaptability. First, China does not need to avoid structural differences and disputes in relations with Japan. It is those differences that China should eliminate for better relations. After the Cold War, Japan has a long history of strategic doubts about China. It will take some time to rebuild confidence and change their views of each other. Second, though the security factor in relations cannot be underestimated, the two countries can also set up a pattern of ""coopetition."" Recognizing that China-Japan relations are one of the most complex and sensitive among major countries, doing away with a mindset of ""problem-based perspective"" when dealing with  ties and giving due respect and understanding each other should be the ""attitude toward Japan"" China needs to re-establish. Last but not the least, Beijing and Tokyo need to build up strategic confidence and determination in improving ties. Although affected by US-Japan relations, China's ties with Japan should not be forever subject to Washington's whims as long as Beijing skillfully handles relations with Tokyo. It will not be wise for China to expect a sudden spurt in ties, but there is a need for making a real difference in its Japan strategy.

Reports, pictures and videos have spread on the internet with many Chinese netiznes connecting the flood to climate change and more calling for action. The Chinese hashtags ""more than half of Venice is drowning,"" ""Venice experiencing the most dangerous week in history"" and ""Venice might be submerged in future decades"" have garnered millions of views on Sina Weibo, a Twitter-like social media in China. ""The 'Water City of Venice' is becoming the 'Underwater City of Venice,'"" a Sina Weibo user said. ""Venice is the city I have been dreaming of visiting,"" expressed another. Net users are connecting the Venetian floods to global climate change. ""Care about the environment and please plant more trees. Prevent the global warming is not just a slogan to shout,"" a Chinese netizen said. More than 200 Weibo users participated in an online survey, among which 91.8 percent believed that climate change is man-made and nature will have its revenge. Others claimed the problem of climate change is not caused by them. The water in Venice reached 1.87 meters above average sea level Tuesday, the second-highest level ever recorded in the city and just 7 centimeters lower than the historic 1966 flood. Another exceptionally high tide followed Wednesday, AP reported.

** Nuclear risks in Marshall Islands expose US moral flaw - Global Times **

* https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1174856.shtml *

              HOME >> OPINION    Nuclear risks in Marshall Islands expose US moral flaw    By Yang Xiyu Source:Global Times Published: 2019/12/26 11:18:39           A mushroom cloud rises with ships below during Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons test on Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands in this 1946 file handout provided by the U.S. Library of Congress. Photo: Xinhua The Los Angeles Times recently published a lengthy investigative report revealing that the US conducted several nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958. The damage inflicted on the central Pacific group of islands and its people continues to this day. In the 1980s, the US built a giant dome in the islands to store the deadly radioactive remains of previous nuclear tests. No safety standards were followed to prevent radiation leakage. The building, now over 40 years old, still poses a risk of toxic radioactive leak from the rising sea level caused by climate change. This is an old issue from history, but it had not been settled fairly until now, which reveals two distinctive features of US foreign relations. The first feature is that Washington's standards are different for treating its own nationals and citizens of other countries. Imagine that safety of US citizens was threatened by nuclear risk as the one on the Marshall Islands, which was revealed by the media after decades, a political storm would have erupted in the US. But when it comes to citizens of other countries, the US government is dealing with it in a different way even though the United States Declaration of Independence states that ""all men are created equal."" In 1988, to address the damage to the environment and local people by the nuclear tests and nuclear residues, the US government agreed to the setting up of a joint Marshall Islands-US court to probe the case. Finally, the court ruled that the US should pay the islands $2.3 billion in compensation. Even such a joint ruling involving the US was overruled by the US Congress and US court. The vetoes by the US Congress and the court gave various reasons for the decision, but the fundamental reason is that the recipient of the compensation is not US citizens. This case is a very typical example of how the US has different standards when it comes to dealing with international disputes involving itself. The US often applies different standards on issues, and these standards are always based on self-interest rather than international ethics. The US only has ""pink lines"" and no ""red lines"" for US foreign policy. The shade of ""pink"" is determined entirely by American interests. Another characteristic is that in dealing with disputes with other countries, Washington does not play by international rules but domestic ones. The fate of the Marshall Islands nuclear test residue disposal and adjudication case most typically reflects the principles of the US as a superpower: American domestic law is superior to international law, and domestic rules are superior to international rules. Objectively, in the absence of an international ban on atmospheric nuclear testing at that time, the nuclear tests by the US in the Marshall Islands should not be condemned. However, how to dispose of the remnants of these nuclear tests and how to implement the ruling of the 1988 Marshall Islands-US joint tribunal are not only a matter of international ethics, but also directly related to the rights of the people of Marshall Islands to survival and development, as well as the authority of international law and rules. Now the US often talks about ""rules-based"" approach, which we should welcome and encourage, and would like to kindly remind the US government and the US Congress: Should there also be a ""rule"" in dealing with nuclear security risks in the Marshall Islands, and should that ""rule"" also be the ""basis""? If Washington had really played by the rules, the Los Angeles Times would not have reported it. People with conscience must recognize a grim reality: Nationals of the Marshall Islands have become the victims of two deadly threats in the world. First, the threat of nuclear security. Since the 1980s, the international community has gradually developed more and more mature international rules and even technical arrangements for strengthening nuclear security and resolving potential problems in the field of nuclear security. The issue of nuclear security in the islands is not difficult to resolve. As long as the US treats the Marshallese people and the American people's nuclear safety issues equally and complies with international rules and security standards, the issue can be resolved fairly. The other is the rise in sea level caused by climate change. The withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement and its failure to deal with the Marshall Islands nuclear issue in accordance with international rules are two different events, but a clear link in policy thinking can be seen. If every country overrides international ethics with its own national interest, and overrides international rules with domestic politics, there will be no international order and all members of the international community, including the violators themselves, will be harmed.

              HOME >> CHINA , SCI-TECH , SOURCE    China uses 1st offshore wind turbine with foreign investment    By Wan Lin Source:Globaltimes.cn Published: 2019/12/19 22:23:48           The No.16 wind turbine of the Dongtai Phase IV-300MW project, which was put into use on Wednesday. The monopile foundation technology has been applied for the first time worldwide in the No.16 wind turbine. Photo: National Energy Group WeChat account China's first offshore wind farm with foreign investment and the country's farthest and most difficult wind farm was put into use on Wednesday in East China, which a project employee said demonstrates foreign companies' trust in China's offshore power market. Seventy-five wind turbines have been connected to the grid, marking the official commissioning of the project, according to a statement issued by the National Energy Group on Wednesday. Located 42 kilometers off the coast of Dongtai, Jiangsu Province, the project, named Dongtai Phase IV-300MW, is expected to generate 810 million kilowatts per year, equivalent to 20 percent of the city's annual electrical consumption, which has a population of more than 1.1 million, the statement said. The project can save 268,500 tons of standard coal annually, accelerating the adjustment of the energy structure to cope with global climate change, according to the statement. The project is one of the two cooperative offshore wind projects signed in March by the China Energy Investment Group and Électricité de France Group (EDF), the leading electricity utility company in France. The total installed capacity of the two projects will be 500 megawatts. This is EDF's first move into the Asian offshore wind power market, which makes the group the first foreign offshore wind power developer to enter China's market, media reported. The Phase V project is expected to be put into operation by 2021, according to an employee working for the project in Dongtai who requested anonymity. EDF participated in the project in an all-round way--from the construction to the operation--the employee told Global Times on Thursday, noting that EDF has brought its own rich experience in offshore power supply to the project. The group's participation shows its trust in the benefits of the project, and reflects the potential of China's offshore power market, the staff said. The National Energy Group's statement noted that the project is the most difficult offshore wind power project in China due to its far distance and complicated water regime, and frequent typhoons in the location. It also noted that the monopile foundation technology has been applied for the first time worldwide to hoist the No.16 wind turbine.

** China to stabilize uncertain world - Global Times **

              HOME >> CHINA    China to stabilize uncertain world    By Yang Sheng Source:Global Times Published: 2019/12/30 23:28:40            The PLA guard of honor escorts the flag of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the national flag, and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) flag during the parade. Photo: He Zhuoqian/GT As the year 2019 comes to an end and the new year is around the corner, many countries and regions around the globe are still suffering from political unrest, sectarian conflict, violent protests and even civil wars. In 2020, more unpredictable incidents will happen or are likely to happen, including the upcoming Brexit , proxy war in Libya, uncertain Korean Peninsula situation and the intensive US presidential election. Rising protectionism and unilateralism, especially in the US, also add more uncertainties and challenges to those global challenges shared by members of the international community such as climate change, terrorism, nuclear-proliferation and the sluggish world economy, said Chinese observers. Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on December 23 that ""today's world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. The more complicated the situation is, the more we need to maintain strategic resolve and adopt a forward-looking vision that takes the overall situation into consideration."" Jin Canrong, associate dean of Renmin University of China's school of international studies in Beijing, told the Global Times that President Xi's remark that ""the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century"" is an assessment that can objectively reflect the current international situation and this assessment could mean China might actively participate in shaping the current world order and reforming globalization system.   Leaders from the G7 group of countries and the European Council attend a working session on international economy and trade and the international security agenda in Biarritz, southwestern France on Sunday, the second day of the annual G7 Summit . Photo: AFP Unconfident West ""When I talked to US scholars, I frequently heard them saying: The only thing that is certain is uncertain,"" Jin said. ""So they share Chinese scholars' feeling over the world situation, but they are more nervous and pessimistic as they found the influence of neo-liberalism that used to guide and lead globalization is declining."" China and the US are likely to reach a trade deal to stop the trade war next year, but Chinese experts warned that US President Donald Trump could be more unpredictable during the presidential election season and even if a deal can be reached, it is hard to be too optimistic as the current US government might not keep its word. A less confident US, which is also facing more domestic pressure, could be more unpredictable, Chinese observers noted. Apart from the trade, the US might exert more pressure on China over Taiwan question and Hong Kong situation, for which China needs to prepare in 2020. Among major Western powers, the US is not the only one shadowed in great uncertainty. The UK is likely to finish Brexit in 2020, but Scotland and Northern Ireland could have weakening ties with the UK and even seek independence, the Financial Times reported on October 31. A massive strike in France is continually hurting the country's economy and French President Emmanuel Macron is facing serious pressure domestically. Zheng Ruolin, a senior Chinese media professional and European studies expert based in France, said that not only France, the whole of Europe including countries like Germany, Spain and Italy will also face similar challenges as the traditional democratic system in Europe is unable to solve their problems. Radical political parties will gain more support and the integration and unity of the EU is in danger, Zheng noted. Problems like immigration and economic decline will hit the continent, he said. Germany is dealing with China and Russia in a more pragmatic and independent approach on issues like Huawei 5G and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project despite pressure from the US. Experts noted that as most European countries are mired in various difficulties, they need stable ties with China and their attitudes will be more pragmatic next year.   Formations featuring a giant national flag and the emblem of the People's Republic of China (PRC) take part in a mass pageantry celebrating the 70th founding anniversary of the PRC in Beijing, capital of China, Oct. 1, 2019. (Xinhua/Ju Zhenhua) China certainty China is facing challenges and difficulties just like other major powers in the world, but China is also going to realize more historic goals next year, ensuring its economic development as well as instilling stability into the region and the world, experts noted. ""China has actually faced extremely serious challenges externally and internally in 2019,"" Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing, told the Global Times. ""Internationally, we have a trade war with the US. Domestically, we have the months-long Hong Kong turmoil, but the country has maintained the stability successfully."" The most important reason is ""the leadership of the CPC,"" Bai said, ""so we can ensure the stability of the country and effectively deal with pressures from the US."" The CPC's leadership is a ""unique advantage of China"" and will continue to safeguard China's development in 2020, he said. China's year-end tone-setting Central Economic Work Conference painted a clear picture of the challenges, prioritized economic stability and pledged a stronger policy repertoire toward completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects in 2020 and beyond, the Xinhua News Agency reported. The successful launch on Friday of Long March 5, China's largest carrier rocket, has laid a solid basis for China to conduct more significant space explorations, including sending a probe to Mars in 2020. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology set a major goal for 2020 on December 23, saying that China aims to offer 5G service in every prefecture-level city by the end of next year. These are of significance not only to China but also to the world, Bai noted. ""Members of the international community understand that cooperation with China is reliable and beneficial,"" Bai said. ""China has the opportunity, confidence and market to offer and to open to anyone."" Cooperation doesn't necessarily bring mutual trust, he noted. ""For instance, China and the US economy are actually interdependent, but the deeper we cooperate, the more desperate the US wants to contain China. This is strange but we have no choice but to be prepared for it."" Neighboring regions For countries in Asia, most are enjoying peace and those who used to have a hostile relationship with China will also try in 2020 to rebuild their ties with Beijing as they don't want to be excluded from the most important source of certainty of the world: the development of China. Japan, for example, made significant change and tried to fix its ties with China. According to Xinhua, Abe said when Xi met him in Beijing that the ""Japanese side looks forward to President Xi's state visit to Japan in the spring next year and attaches great importance to the visit."" Japan is also a victim of US protectionism and unilateralism, said Chinese experts. It is natural for Tokyo to re-consider its position between China and the US. To stand closer with China would be wise as China has more certainty than the US, they argued. India, another major power in Asia, is now struggling to deal with mass protests and unrest, while witnessing- worsening ties with its neighbor Pakistan. Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the institute of international relations of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that India's economy will be impacted for sure and the effects will continue to next year. If the unrest and conflict continue, it is possible to see an economic crisis in the country to which China should pay attention, as China has investments and cooperation projects in the country. The Korean Peninsula is another region of huge uncertainty. Although the leaders of the US and North Korea met twice in 2019 in Vietnam and the DMZ between the two Koreas, the peace process is now in a deadlock. China's participation and mediation in the peace process of Korean Peninsula is the key to safeguarding the peace of the region and also a reason why provocations between Pyongyang and Washington didn't escalate, experts believed. China will keep playing this role in 2020, they said.

** China boosts Ethiopia's space program - Global Times **

* https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1174390.shtml *

              HOME >> OPINION    China boosts Ethiopia’s space program    By Shen Shiwei Source:Global Times Published: 2019/12/22 17:58:39            Ethiopia's first-ever satellite, known as ETRSS-1, is launched on a Long March-4B carrier rocket at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in North China's Shanxi Province on Dec 20, 2019. Photo: Xinhua What does Ethiopia's first-ever satellite mean to this Horn of Africa country and the space program of the African continent at large? The dream came true on Friday. Ethiopia has become the 11th country in Africa to have its satellite launched after South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Kenya, Sudan, Angola, Nigeria, Ghana and Rwanda. At the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in North China's Shanxi Province, a Long March-4B carrier rocket brought a wide-range multispectral remote-sensing microsatellite donated to Ethiopia into space. The satellite program under the Belt and Road South-South Cooperation Initiative on Climate Change is the latest example of South-South Cooperation. It also points to space ambitions of several African countries. Not surprisingly, China's assistance and cooperation with African countries has again come under scrutiny by some Western media outlets. Many European space and defense companies have dominated Africa's satellite and telecommunications markets for decades. For example, Egypt's first telecommunications satellite the Tiba 1 was launched from French Guiana in South America. The satellite was developed by Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space as co-prime contractors, with the former acting as the consortium's lead partner. But why is scrutiny of those Western companies over their intention of developing Africa's satellites rare? For sure, the satellite will add a semblance of independence to Ethiopia's development. Ethiopia is proud of its independence as it has never been colonized by a Western power. As a country of over 100 million people, Ethiopia had to spend precious foreign reserve to get information from foreign-owned satellites for many years. But now, everything will change with the ETRSS-1(Ethiopian Remote Sensing Satellite) launched with China's help. Ethiopia will observe its own satellite from the astronomical observatory at the Entoto Hills, Addis Ababa. According to Ethiopian government, the satellite will be used for agriculture, mining, environmental protection and earth observatory purposes. It is also an important tool to issue alerts about the impact of climate change since extreme weather and drought caused food crisis in the country several years ago. What's more, the ETRSS-1 project will help Ethiopia develop space techniques of operating and managing the satellite since 21 Ethiopian scientists have participated in the program, five of whom are women. The ETRSS-1 will not be Ethiopia's first ""baby,"" and more is likely to come in the future. Will China's help to Ethiopia to launch a satellite inject competition in Africa's satellite market? Give back to business what is business' and to international development aid what is international development aid's. Africa's need for satellites is vast and countries providing competitive price and better technologies will win the bid. Over the last 50 years, the number of countries that have launched satellites into the Earth's orbit has increased dramatically. But many African countries have to depend on renting costly foreign-owned satellites for economic and social development needs including telecommunication, weather forecast, agriculture monitoring and so on. To reduce dependency on foreign satellites, several countries inked a cooperation program with companies from the US, Europe, Russia and Japan to launch their own satellites. Moreover, many satellite service companies from emerging markets like the Middle East and Asia-Pacific want to have their market share. But African countries still need to accumulate their own systemic capacity in satellite development, according to the space program initiated by the African Union. Hereby, China's space technology could provide a good option, both for international development and business programs. Taking Ethiopia's first satellite as an example, the international development aid program will not only cover the launch, but also help Ethiopia build comprehensive capacity including talent training, experience sharing and the establishment of ground monitoring system. Similar programs have also been launched in Egypt. Early last September, the implementation phase of China-aided MisrSat II satellite project in Egypt kicked off. The program aims to improve Egypt's satellite development technology capacity. Meanwhile, Egypt is the first country to carry out satellite cooperation with China under the framework of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative. Is China only providing grants for satellite? Of course not. Back in 2007, Chinese companies won the bid for Nigerian satellite projects via commercial competition. Countries adopt Chinese technology mainly because of all solutions could meet their standards. Since then, Chinese innovated and competitive technologies have gradually become known to African countries. Maybe in the future, there will be joint cooperation among companies from China, Africa and other countries. The space is vast enough for cooperation.

              HOME >> CHINA    Another record-breaking rise in ocean temperatures in 2019: report    By Zhang Hui Source:Global Times Published: 2020/1/14 11:53:40            Ocean warming poses a threat to food security and people's livelihoods. Photo:Zhu Jiang A new report shows the world's oceans were the warmest in 2019 than at any other time in recorded human history, and authors of the report warn that more catastrophic fires like those that have ravaged the Amazon and Australia are likely, and called for urgent action to reverse climate change. The paper, titled ""Record-setting ocean warmth continued in 2019"", was published by the international journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences on Monday. It was written by 14 scientists from 11 institutes around the world, Cheng Lijing, the lead author and associate professor with the International Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The paper also concludes the past decade has been the warmest 10 years on record for global ocean temperatures, with each of the past five years breaking successive records. According to the study, the 2019 ocean temperature is about 0.075 C above the 1981-2010 average, and the global ocean temperature is not only increasing, but is rising more quickly. The amount of additional heat the world's oceans have taken in over the past 25 years is equal to 3.6 billion Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions, Cheng said. He said that the ocean warming is proof of global warming, and since 1970, more than 90 percent of heat caused by global warming was absorbed by oceans, harming marine life, generating stronger storms, reducing fish harvests and damaging ocean-related economies. The South China Sea and China's other coastal waters are also suffering from rising global ocean temperatures, Cheng said. High temperatures caused the deaths of sea cucumbers in a large area in Northeast China's Liaoning Province in the summer of 2018, Cheng said. 2019 broke the previous records set in prior years for global warming, and the effects are already appearing in the form of more extreme weather, rising sea levels and harm to ocean animals, the authors said. ""Global heating is one of the reasons for the increase in catastrophic fires in the Amazon, California and Australia in 2019, and we're seeing that continue into 2020,"" Cheng said. The Australian bushfires have killed at least 27 people and a billion animals, reports have said. Cheng warned that more disasters like the Australian bushfire will take place as global warming intensifies. As sea levels rise, coastal cities worldwide especially in Malaysia and the Maldives, will have to deal with submerged land. The authors called for stepped up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop new energy sources and transition to a clean energy society to help mitigate the impact of global warming and better prepare for the upcoming challenges.

              HOME >> WORLD    Australian ‘megablaze’ brought under control after burning for about 3 months    Source:AFP Published: 2020/1/13 21:13:40           Screenshot of a video showing an Australian woman Toni Doherty rescuing a koala from a bushfire in New South Wales on November 19, 2019. Exhausted firefighters said they had finally brought Australia's largest ""megablaze"" under control on Monday, as wet weather promised to deliver much-needed respite for countryside ravaged by bushfires. New South Wales firefighters said they finally had the upper hand in the fight against the vast Gospers Mountain fire on Sydney's northwestern outskirts, which has been burning for almost three months. Visiting the area on Monday, New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said there was a ""small area of burning still to complete"" but the ""containment prognosis looks promising."" The fire seared an area of national park three times the size of Greater London and lit several connected blazes totalling over 800,000 hectares. As residents and authorities continued to come to grips with the sheer scale of the devastation, the Bureau of Meteorology forecast some firegrounds areas could get up to 50 millimeters of rain in the next week, a relief after a prolonged drought. If that forecast bears out, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said it would be ""all of our Christmas , birthday, engagement, anniversary, wedding and graduation presents rolled into one. Fingers crossed."" Dozens of other fires are yet to be controlled. The climate-change-fuelled fires have prompted an international outpouring and donations from around the world to help communities and animal populations. Australia's unique flora and fauna has taken a catastrophic hit, with an estimated 1 billion animals killed, and countless trees and shrubs burned away. The country's environment minister Sussan Ley has warned that in some areas, koalas may have to be reclassified as endangered. The government has earmarked an initial A$50 million ($35 million) to spend on helping with the wildlife recovery.

** Australia bushfires a wake-up call for the world - Global Times **

              HOME >> OPINION    Australia bushfires a wake-up call for the world    Source:Global Times Published: 2020/1/8 20:33:40           Photo taken on Dec 20, 2019 shows fire trucks working at Lexton bush fire site in western Victoria, Australia. Photo: Xinhua Four months after Australia's bushfires started burning, they have spread to an area larger than Denmark and killed at least 24 people. The air quality of cities such as Canberra, the capital, has deteriorated sharply. Many people lost their home in the fire. Fires are first and foremost a common natural phenomenon in Australia. This year's dry and rain-free climate has particularly contributed to the forest fires spread widely. There has been a lot of criticism in Australia about how little the government has done to bring the blazes under control. In our view, this fire is too intense for the Australian government and society to deal with. In the past, Australia has had forest fires every year, but local governments have been able to control them with a conventional response. The country has no mechanism for dealing with super fires. Australia is sparsely populated, although most area of the country is desert but the per capita forest area is still very large. It is not very distressing if there is a local fire. As a result, the country has to an extent relaxed the vigilance. Australia not only has a weak disaster prevention system, but also a limited ability to cope with calamities. Prime Minister Scott Morrison was widely criticized for taking his family on vacation to Hawaii during the fire. In fact, this reflects the country's lax disaster response system. Most firefighters fighting the blazes are volunteers. The professional fire fighting team was seriously not enough to deal with the scale of the disaster. Unfortunately, the government did not urgently expand the mobilization capacity of professional firefighting teams at critical moments. The nationwide fires could play a role in focusing Australia's attention to the scourge. The Australian Liberal government has always had a negative attitude toward emission reductions. In recent years, it has particularly followed the Trump administration's environmental policies and refused to contribute to the global emission reduction cause. Climate change is the obvious culprit. Australia's input in disaster prevention is too small. Countries around the world are constantly increasing their investment in technology and people to prevent bushfires. Preventative system is expensive. An emergency response system that can quickly mobilize enough expertise to respond to a disaster is also expensive. Australia is clearly failing badly at both levels. As a developed country, Australia is not short of money, but has allocated too little funds for disaster prevention and mitigation. In recent years, national security has attracted too much attention from the Australian government and elite groups. In fact, some of their concerns, such as the ""China threat"", are influenced by changes in the US strategy toward China and have consumed too much energy and resources. It must be noted that natural disasters are at the top of the list of threats in most countries of the world today. As a country facing serious natural disaster threats and geopolitical risks, China dare not focus its national efforts in the latter direction and let problems in the former go unchecked. China's economic development level is still not high enough, and disasters are still frequent. Disaster prevention and reduction has always been one of the Chinese government's top daily concerns, and China has been making unremitting efforts in building relevant systems. The nationwide bushfires in Australia offer a lesson for the world and are a wake-up call for the international community: Given the increasing convenience with which the world can connect and mobilize its forces, the world should explore a massive increase in the level of collaborative response to super-natural disasters. It is difficult for a country like Australia to respond to a national fire disaster all by itself. Previously, Brazil's Amazon rainforest fires were equally prominent. How the world should join hands to deal with such a disaster crisis deserves serious discussion.

              HOME >> CHINA    Scientist plants corals in South China Sea to save ecosystem    By Li Lei Source:Global Times Published: 2020/1/9 22:28:42           Huang Hui observes a coral branch. Photo: Courtesy of Huang Hui For Huang Hui, planting corals in the deep sea is the most beautiful job in the world. ""Coral reefs are rainforests under sea, like a garden in the water,"" said Huang. ""It is significant to recover and protect them,"" Huang told the Global Times. Covering less than two-thousandth of the space in the ocean, coral reefs provide shelter for more than a quarter of the world's sea creatures. However, this ecosystem that has existed for hundreds of millions of years has come under threat in the past few decades. Huang, a research fellow of the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences based in Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province, has worked on coral research and protection for 22 years. Xisha Islands in the South China Sea was once a paradise for fish and algae. It is now silent in the water there because the coral reefs are in critical situation, Huang said. In 2002, Huang went scuba diving in the waters near Xisha. In addition to getting an irremovable suntan, she was left with memories of a beautiful experience with crystal clear water and an abundance of colorful corals and spiral shells. However, much of the breathtaking scenery of this reef has disappeared due to climate change and human activities. All of these factors led to the decline of the coral reef in the near shore waters. ""We started to cultivate corals near the Xisha Islands in 2010, and restored more than 200,000 square meters of coral reefs,"" Huang told the Global Times.   Huang Hui dives to the seabed to plant coral. The framework will be recycled after two years. Photo: Courtesy of Huang Hui Conservation crusader ""Global warming is the reason for the disappearance of reefs in the world range, adding impact to other human activities such as overexploitation and coastal development,"" Huang told the Global Times. After conducting environmental investigation and water evaluation, Huang and her team started to pick coral larvae and plant them on a man-made framework in the sea. After eight months to a year, these corals are planted on the seabed. It indeed seems to be the most beautiful work in the world, but Huang has to overcome difficult conditions both on land and in the sea. ""We have to overcome the nausea when we were on a boat, which is painstaking,"" said Huang. After seasickness, Huang has to wear a 15-kilogram scuba diving kit as the seawater moves forcefully around the diving site. ""I vomit sometimes in the water,"" said Huang. She dives in the deep sea every winter. At night she may encounter poisonous creatures such as cone snails or certain sea urchins. ""I told my students that if you love the job, diving is a joy, otherwise, you will only feel the pain, so you might as well love it,"" she said. ""A hammering wave of 10 meters under water takes much more strength than the same move on the land, and it takes more oxygen, so I had to change my oxygen tank every 20 minutes,"" said Huang. But her happiness lies in the sea. ""They grow so fast! I was thrilled when I returned and saw that they grew a lot,"" said Huang, adding that she gained so much joy from meeting her research goals. In order to increase the corals' survival rate, Huang had to learn about their living and reproduction patterns. ""Coral is a creature that lives in the waters with high-transparency and with a temperature between 22 and 28 C, since it obtains nutrition from the photosynthesis of algae,"" said Huang. After 20 years of hard work in the sea, Huang and her team have a clear picture of the reproduction patterns of corals in the South China Sea. They can expect the corals' ovulation period with only a three-day margin of error.   Huang Hui dives underwater ter to inspect coral reefs. Photo: Courtesy of Huang Hui Collaborative approach In 2004, when Huang was attending the 10th International Coral Reef Symposium, she found herself the only representative from the Chinese mainland. She said she felt sad but she made up her mind to reinforce communication with other countries to improve China's level and status in coral research. She visited top coral research institutes in the US and Australia, establishing long-term cooperation and exchanges with some of the world's top coral researchers. ""Now, China is in a leading position in terms of technology and coral planting scale,"" Huang told the Global Times. Huang believes that people's awareness of coral protection matters to the sustainable development of the coral reefs. ""I want to call on more people to love nature and look at the ocean in awe,"" Huang said. As a result of the efforts of Huang's team and other parties, Hainan Province released a law in 2017 banning reef exploitation, trafficking and damaging. Huang works as a consultant for customs and frontier police on coral protection and promotes coral protection in her local schools. Huang also provides online free training for scuba divers to teach them proper behavior in the sea to protect coral reefs. ""A group of 'folk scientists' have also been trained with the hope that more people can gain awareness of the significance of coral reef protection and know how to protect them,"" said Huang. ""I am 50, and when I become 60, I hope that not only a coral island will be built but a sustainable development pattern will also be created,"" said Huang. ""The ideal state is that the coral island should be able to support fishermen and preserve the ecosystem,"" she added. The force of an individual might be small, but she expressed confidence that others will act to save our oceans, and that one day, she will once again see those beautiful coral reefs that have disappeared.

** Raging bushfires expose multiple governance woes of Australia ... **

              HOME >> OPINION    Raging bushfires expose multiple governance woes of Australia    By Chen Hong Source:Global Times Published: 2020/1/7 22:03:41           Screenshot of a video showing an Australian woman Toni Doherty rescuing a koala from a bushfire in New South Wales on November 19, 2019. As the new year dawns, the whole world is aghast at the devastating bushfires raging across Australia, where more than 20 lives have been lost and many more people are unaccounted for. Heart-wrenching images of ravaged villages and townships, residents forced to flee homes, and 500 million koalas, kangaroos, wombats and other wild life creatures perishing in the inferno have brought to living rooms the intensity of the inferno. The bushfire started in early August last year, destroying large swathes of forest tracts. To date the most populous and economically active states, including New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, have been gravely hit, with the unprecedented dire aftermaths. Port and airport operations have been disrupted, with agriculture, husbandry, tourism and other economic sectors badly hit. With the current tragedy, the situation has gradually got out of hand. There are natural causes to the calamity. The persisting drought and record high temperatures have made self combustion easier and fire fighting efforts extremely difficult. The flammable eucalyptus trees and the flat topography let the firestorms spread easily. Sudden change in wind direction often makes flame movements unpredictable, and frequent dry lightnings ignite new blazes in the bush tinder. There are, however, human factors involved. Australia takes only 0.3 percent of the world population, but its greenhouse gas emission level is as high as 1.3 percent, making it one of the world's biggest emitters. Australia's target of carbon reduction has been criticized as too low and the government has not been too willing to take concrete steps. In addition to being the world's fourth largest producer of coal, Australia is also a major exporter of fossil fuels, causing emission rise not only in the country, but in the export destinations as well. The newly endorsed Adani Carmichael coal mine project in Queensland has gone ahead in spite of widespread opposition in the country. There have been unyielding voices in Australia refuting links between the wrecking calamity and climate change. Former prime minister Tony Abbott has been a staunch denier of the scientific evidence of climate change, in particular of the relationship between the emission of carbon dioxide and global warming. Scott Morrison, the current Prime Minister, has said he will not make ""reckless"" cuts to the coal industry. Such attitude and approach is naturally hazardous to nature. Rise in temperatures and the resulting lack of humidity have been among the major causes of the tragedy wreaking havoc across Australia. In Australia, the fire safety and protection services are mainly the responsibility of the states and territories, causing a dysfunctional gulf between the federal authorities and the state and territory governments, as well as among the provinces. As Australia is a land perennially haunted by the bushfire menace, it is imperative to create national and inter-state schemes to better coordinate fire prevention and combating efforts. The Australian fire fighting services consist largely of volunteers who, though extremely dedicated and highly skilled, have their own commitments. Only recently has the federal government mobilized the armed forces to participate in the rescue and evacuation missions. Regretfully, recurrent mistakes by the federal authorities in handling the raging fire have also complicated matters. Morrison in December last year left to holiday in Hawaii with his family, which caused a massive outcry in the country. Recently, the Prime Minister injudiciously released a clumsy social media video extolling his government's efforts to combat the national catastrophe for partisan gains. The hottest months in Australia are January and February, which means the worst time is only starting. In his recent statement, Chinese Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye paid tribute to those who have been suffering heavy losses in the disaster. We share his conviction that ultimately the terrible bushfires will be reined in with the heroism and dedication of the Australian people.

** Time to seek more inclusive world order in era of 'westlessness ... **

              HOME >> OPINION    Time to seek more inclusive world order in era of 'westlessness'    By Wang Huiyao Source:Global Times Published: 2020/2/18 19:22:35           Chairman of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) Wolfgang Ischinger addresses the closing session of the 56th MSC in Munich, Germany, Feb. 16, 2020. The 56th MSC closed on Sunday as attendees didn't share consensus on ""Westlessness,"" the theme of this year's conference. The debates on ""Westlessness,"" which refers to the loss of common standing of what it means to be part of the West, would likely continue. (Xinhua/Lu Yang) China once again became the center of world attention at the just concluded 56th Munich Security Conference (MSC) themed ""westlessness."" Two implications can be observed from this theme. First, with the rise of emerging countries such as China, China has becoming a dominated subject in many discussions of the conference, including US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper's very negative remarks on China. Second, rifts in the Western camp are increasing and deepening. With the US advocating ""America First,"" the US-Europe alliance has met unprecedented challenges. Meanwhile, the gap between some members within the European Union are also growing due to the impact of populism. ""The West is less Western… The world as a whole is less Western,"" said Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the MSC, on February 10. This really shows that Western countries have gathered for the first time to reflect and rethink what went wrong and what can be done. In 2019, the world witnessed various global challenges, such as US-launched trade wars, the paralysis of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism, and deadlocked international cooperation on climate change. Waves of anti-globalization, represented by populism and trade protectionism, are more prevalent. Divisions have spread from trade to politics, technology, military, religion and ideology. The world is undergoing profound changes and facing great unseen challenges this century, especially for Western countries. Nonetheless, the trend of globalization can never be reversed. Constantly developed technologies and global value chains have entwined countries around the world. Not a single member of the international community can tackle all the challenges alone and play a world savior. In response to ""westlessness,"" countries should jointly explore a path in the world where the West and the East can coexist. For world to have a new narrative to evolve from the Cold War division of West and East, humankind should confront our common challenges such as climate change, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, trafficking, poverty reductions and epidemic diseases. In order to do this, first of all, Western countries need to accept China's peaceful rise and view China's development as a contribution to the mankind and be tolerant to the path that China has chosen based on its successful experience in the past four decades. China also needs to be more open and should come up with a new convincing way of presenting itself, so as to dispel the West's concerns over its rise. The world is now moving toward multipolarity. Traditional Western powers no longer hold overwhelming superiority in terms of economic, political, technological and military influence over the world. Newly emerging countries such as China, Russia, India, Brazil and ASEAN countries will play more active roles in the world affairs. Many global issues can only be settled through international cooperation. The world needs to embrace new inventions and technological development together such as 5G, AI, Big Data, automation, blockchain and internet of things etc. Today, Western countries are facing new challenges, which can be seen from the multiple crisis the West has encountered in recent years, including the refugee crisis, the financial crisis, and terrorist attacks and rising populism. Western countries should consider whether their model is applicable to all countries and whether they need to tolerate successful new models or have peaceful coexistence of the development paths of other countries. The 2020 MSC is in essence the Western countries' collective efforts to reflect on themselves and to seek for a better global development framework. It is the common challenge facing all countries to get rid of the divisions that separate the Western and the Eastern world, because emphasizing differences will only lead to further divisions. Second, developing countries should assume more international responsibility and engage more in building and enhancing in innovation in global governane. Western countries probably can take more consideration since newly emerging countries are much different than they were two decades ago. They are making more substantial efforts in contributing to world GDP growth, addressing more global issues, protecting intellectual property rights, promoting free trade, opposing counter-globalization, and contributing to a community with a shared future for humanity. As the world's largest developing country, China is responsible and capable of engaging in international affairs. Since the beginning of its reform and opening-up, China has made remarkable contributions to the world economy while boosting its own. According to the World Bank, China has enabled ""more than 700 million rural people to lift themselves out of poverty, which accounts for more than 70 percent of global poverty population since early the 1980s."" In recent years, China has proposed the Belt and Road Initiative and initiated new global governance institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which has, to some extent, filled the gap in the traditional global infrastructure building system. Meanwhile, as a determined advocate of multilateralism, China is also playing an irreplaceable role in promoting regional security, prosperity and stability. Some countries are concerned about China's rise. This requires China to make further exchanges with the world and further reform and opening-up. At a time when the international community is entangled in differences and debates, China should carry forward its long-held spirit which values harmony, and continue to build community with a shared future for humanity. Third, all countries should jointly build a new globalized world with more equality, inclusiveness and fairness. The uncertainty of the humanity's future is increasing, and division, confrontation, and shirking responsibilities will not solve the problems. Thus, we need a more inclusive and equal global order and inclusive globalization for all. With the debate of the West is less or more, China needs to focus more on how to promote global development and adjust its role in the international community and make more contributions to the world.

** UN calls for donations to tackle desert locusts in Africa - Global Times **

              HOME >> WORLD    UN calls for donations to tackle desert locusts in Africa    Source:AFP Published: 2020/2/11 17:53:42           Farmers attempt to scare away locusts from their farms in Mwingi North, Kenya, Jan. 29, 2020. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said late in January that it requires 7 billion shillings (about 70 million U.S. dollars) to tackle the locust plague that has already infested the Horn of Africa. (Xinhua/Fred Mutune) The UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs called on the international community Monday to help East African countries affected by locust swarms, expressing his deep concern over the situation. ""There are 13 million people in the affected countries who are severely food insecure now,"" said Mark Lowcock during a UN press conference. ""Ten million of those people are in the places affected by locusts."" Lowcock, who said he had recently released $10 million for the crisis, warned that ""unless there was a rapid response, we are going to have a huge problem later in the year."" The locusts have devastated food supplies in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. They were reported in Uganda on Sunday. According to Lowcock, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimated at the end of January that a locust control plan would cost $76 million. ""What we have so far is just $20 million,"" he said. ""Unless we get a grip of this in the next two or three or four weeks, we are worried we are going to have a really serious problem."" Lowcock said that the locust outbreak was ""the worst for 70 years in Kenya, for 25 years in Ethiopia, Somalia,"" and said that one of the reasons behind the swarms was climate change. Desert locusts - whose destructive infestations cause major crop damage - are a species of grasshopper that live largely solitary lives until a combination of conditions promote breeding and lead them to form massive swarms. Swarms formed in eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia have moved through the region. The FAO says the current invasion is known as an ""upsurge"" - when an entire region is affected - however, if it gets worse and cannot be contained, over a year or more, it would become what is known as a ""plague"" of locusts. There have been six major desert locust plagues in the 1900s, the last of which was in 1987-89. The last major upsurge was in 2003-05.

** Star Lena Dunham's catwalk debut kick-starts London Fashion Week **

* https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1179720.shtml *

              HOME >> ARTS    Star Lena Dunham's catwalk debut kick-starts London Fashion Week    Source:AFP Published: 2020/2/16 17:51:44           A model presents a creation by Richard Quinn at London Fashion Week, in London on Saturday. Photo: IC British style icon Vivienne Westwood unveiled her latest offerings and US actress Lena Dunham made a catwalk debut as London Fashion Week got underway Friday under the shadow of the novel coronavirus epidemic. The five-day showcase in the British capital will feature more than 60 shows, including Burberry and Tommy Hilfiger, but with participation dented by the deadly outbreak spreading around the world. The COVID-19 epidemic - as the World Health Organization has formally named it - has so far claimed around 1,400 lives and infected nearly 64,000 people. The vast majority have been in China, the source of the outbreak, but as it has spread there have also been nine cases identified in Britain. The British Fashion Council (BFC), which organizes the event, said it expected attendance from Chinese media and buyers ""to be significantly reduced"" due to the travel restrictions imposed as a result of the outbreak. Chief Executive Caroline Rush announced a partnership with the Business of Fashion China media platform ""to ensure that our two audiences remain incredibly connected."" But BFC chairwoman Stephanie Phair tried to downplay the obvious concerns encroaching on one of the global fashion industry's key gatherings. ""It is absolutely a topic but the fashion industry has always faced challenges and is a resilient industry,"" she told AFP. Sustainability focus US acting star and Girls creator Dunham made her surprise runway debut for London-based brand 16Arlington, sporting wet hair, a gold leaf dress and a leather jacket. ""Lena is amazing,"" Marco Capaldo, its co-founder along with Kikka Cavenati, told AFP. ""Apart from being a dear friend, she stands for such positivity and she is a real force for change and we love that,"" he said. Meanwhile Westwood presented her autumn/winter 2020/21 collection, inspired by British and Italian traditions, at the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park with an overtly political message of support for jailed Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. ""I'm taking the opportunity of London Fashion Week to defend human rights and free speech,"" she said in a statement calling for protests when the whistleblower's trial over extradition to the US begins later this month in Britain. Some of the models at her show wore black and white masks to represent a decapitated man's face while a pillory was on display. London's turn in the fashion spotlight opened Friday with the debut show by Yuhan Wang, a London-based designer originally from Weihai in East China's Shandong Province. She showed long and light floral dresses, dominated by lace with a bohemian, melancholic feel. Also showing in London this week are queen of punk rock culture Pam Hogg, along with big British names such as Chalayan, JW Anderson and Victoria Beckham. Meanwhile Vienna-based designer Petar Petrov will be among the newcomers showcasing at Fashion East, London's pioneering non-profit initiative championing emerging talent. After largely deserting New York Fashion Week in recent years, Tommy Hilfiger returns to London to unveil his fourth ""TommyxLewis"" collection, which has a strong focus on sustainability. 'Creative disruptions' With climate change concerns paramount, an increasing number of designers are choosing to use renewable materials and support local crafts. That trend is set to feature in the collections of Mulberry, Phoebe English, and Johnstons of Elgin - all with a strong production presence in England. Under pressure from environmental activists, London organizers are trying to improve the image of the event and promote good practices. They include a ""switch to blue"" campaign to bring the industry together ""to lead in ambitious environmental action,"" as well as a collaboration with designer Richard Malone for a reusable canvas bag. On Tuesday, young designer Rosh Mahtani, founder of the jewelry brand Alighieri, is set to receive the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design, for her ""ethical approach and commitment to local manufacturing."" However, activist group Extinction Rebellion has called for next season's event in September to be scrapped, denouncing the fashion industry's ""exploitation of [the] planet, people and animals."" It has previously protested at London Fashion Week and plans further ""creative disruptions."" Meanwhile, the perceived threat of COVID-19 looms large in the background. Organizers said they would carry out ""deep cleans"" every evening at the event's central London hub, while anti-bacterial hand sanitizer will be made available throughout the venue. But concerns about the outbreak go well beyond the immediate threat to those attending. British fashion house Burberry warned last week of a ""material negative effect on luxury demand,"" as Chinese consumers stayed at home.

** In interfering WIPO election, US lays bare toxic 'America First ... **

              HOME >> WORLD    In interfering WIPO election, US lays bare toxic 'America First' agenda    By Cong Ge Source:Global Times Published: 2020/3/1 17:27:07           Photo: GT When US President Donald Trump put forth his ""America First"" agenda a few years ago, the world scrambled to find out what exactly it entails and what would be the implications. Then the US ripped apart existing trade deals, tossed out hard-fought international agreements on a wide range of issues from climate change to Iran's nuclear program and global arms control, abandoned UN agencies and crippled the WTO. Finally, the world came to see the ugly truth of that agenda, under which the US seeks to maximize its selfish interests through whatever it takes, even if that means unscrupulously cracking down on other countries, shamelessly disregarding international norms and rules, and irresponsibly wreaking havoc on the global community. That brings us to the election next week for the new director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a UN agency tasked with overseeing the world's vast intellectual property (IP) systems. The election in itself should be a standard matter - member states make their nominations and vote for the candidate best equipped to run the agency. Perfectly in line with WIPO rules, China nominated Wang Binying, a highly-regarded professional who is currently serving as the deputy director general. But as the world has witnessed in recent weeks, the US, which has no candidate of its own on the ballot, has singlehandedly highjacked the conversation about the election, which should focus on professional merits of the candidates, by injecting its poisonous politics into the process. And in doing so, it has once again laid bare its selfishness and bigotry under the ""American First"" agenda. Following Wang's nomination, certain US officials and other figures have mounted a fierce campaign against her candidacy, spitting out obsolete accusations against China's IP system without any shred of evidence, lobbying other countries to vote for ""anyone but Chinese"" and even threatening to cut aid for countries that refuse to bow to its will. In an article in the Financial Times last week, Peter Navarro, a top trade advisor at the White House, openly called for the US government to interfere in the WIPO election to deny China's nominee, citing the US' baseless accusations of poor IP protection and IP theft by China. Indicating that the US was following up such a call with action, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has reportedly said that the US was ""tracking"" the election ""very, very closely"" and was ""engaged in lots of conversations."" Remarkably, the main target of the US' campaign is not Wang's credentials, which are impeccable as even some US experts noted. Instead, they aimed their firepower at China's IP system with groundless yet fearmongering rhetoric. ""China is the [No. 1] threat to IP,""  John Bolton, the former US National Security Advisor who was fired last year, wrote in a tweet on Friday. Facts speak louder than words. For any fair-minded person, China's progress in IP over the past years is nothing less than a miracle. Starting from scratch, China has built a robust IP protection system in line with global rules and standards within just four decades. Global inventors and businesses should know China's IP environment better than any of these US politicians. In 2019, entities from 186 countries and regions filed 157,000 patent applications and 255,000 trademark applications in China, up 6 percent and 4.7 percent year-on-year, official data showed. Noticeably, US entities filed for 39,000 patent applications and 54,000 trademark applications in China. If China had such a poor IP protection system as some US politicians describe, why are foreign entities flocking to China to register new IPs? If China was such a terrible place to do business as these US politicians describe, why would US companies, such as Apple and Tesla, rush to invest in China? The fact remains that world organizations and many foreign experts have recognized China's progress in IP protection. The WTO Trade Policy Reviews on China in 2018 fully affirmed China's IP protection and noted China's various policies and measures in that regard. How could the US turn a blind eye to all of these? Could it be because these US politicians are sour over China's rise as a global leader in innovation and make an ill attempt to contain it? Indeed, China has become a leading force in global innovation. It topped the world's ranking for new patent application filings for a ninth consecutive year and for trademarks for an 18th straight year in 2019. China's ranking in the Global Innovation Index report released by WIPO and other organizations has jumped from 35th place in 2013 to 14th in 2019. China has the largest pool of active researchers - 1.7 million in 2016 - and is the second-biggest spender in research and development - 1.97 trillion yuan ($281.8 billion) in 2018. Needless to say China did not get to where it is today by just stealing from others. Obviously, these facts do not matter for these US politicians because they do not fit into their narrative of China as a threat to everything and, more importantly, their ulterior motive to contain China at all costs. However, some of those costs will also be borne by the US itself, at least in terms of its credibility, if there is any left after actions of launching bruising trade wars and crippling critical global organizations. Even in the area of IP, the US has no creditability as the world has seen in Washington's crackdown on Chinese telecom firm Huawei without any proof. Despite fierce lobbying and even threats from the US against using Huawei's technology, many, including some of its European allies, did not budge. What does that say about the US' credibility? But that did not stop the US from meddling in the WIPO election. Washington has brought the same exact playbook, whether it's relentless efforts to smear China and paint China as a threat or threats to other countries to bend at its will. However, one thing that should be absolutely clear to every member state is that this is not merely an attack on China, rather it's a continuity of the US' ""America First"" agenda. It is not about furthering the multilateral agency's mission, but rather it is very much about putting Washington's interests above all the other member states. Illuminating the reason behind Washington's fierce campaign against China's candidate, James Pooley, a former deputy director general of the agency in charge of the critical Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, wrote on Thursday that the WIPO is the only one agency in the UN that ""actually delivers practical value to US businesses."" That is almost like saying the US can abandon all the other UN branches but it has to fight for the WIPO. It is clear that Washington's endgame here is not just stopping Wang from becoming the next director general. Containing China might fit into the US' policy, but, in this case, it might just be a means to put its self-interests at the WIPO above all the others. It would surely not stop meddling in WIPO's work unless the whole agency serves its interests as opposed to the shared interests of all member states, not matter who wins the election. The US has long criticized the WIPO for alleged corruption and for working with China, Russia, North Korea and Iran - all members of the WIPO. In 2016, a US lawmaker, Christopher Smith, called the WIPO ""the FIFA of UN agencies"" suggesting the agency was as corrupt as the world soccer organization that was engulfed in a massive corruption scandal. Smith even ""invited"" Francis Gurry, the outgoing WIPO chief from Australia, to appear before a hearing at the US Congress. Let this sink in for a bit. A US lawmaker asked the head of a multilateral agency to be questioned at the US Congress as if the WIPO is part of the US government. That should be extremely alarming to all WIPO members. And as they cast their vote next week, they should keep in mind that Washington's true motive in attacking Wang's candidacy is not about selecting the best candidate to run the agency for the common interests of all member states. Bending over at the will of US politics will only invite more blatant interference in WIPO's work.

** Meet Thailand's secret weapon in climate change battle - Global Times **

* https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1181706.shtml *

              HOME >> ARTS    Meet Thailand's secret weapon in climate change battle    Source:AFP Published: 2020/3/5 20:38:41         Bangkok's future hangs in the balance. Rising sea levels, unchecked development, groundwater extraction, and rapid urban population growth has left millions vulnerable to natural disasters - scientists warn the city itself may not survive the century.   Bangkok, the captial city of Thailand Photo: VCG New analysis by the Nestpick 2050 Climate Change City Index says the Thai capital could be hardest hit by global warming. And while it is not alone facing such a threat - Venice, New Orleans, and Jakarta are predicted to be underwater by 2100 - it does have a secret weapon in its battle to negate the impact of a hotter planet: renowned architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom, who preaches mindful development over mindless construction. ""We are talking life and death in this situation,"" says the 39-year-old who is hoping to bring Bangkok back from the brink, as scientists warn extreme weather - flooding and droughts - could ravage the city, leaving as much as 40 percent submerged in the next decade. Kotchakorn says: ""I don't want to face it with fear. At this moment we have a chance to make change... We have to do it right now to show the coming generations that this is possible. It is not about sitting and waiting and doing the same thing."" No one can accuse the Harvard graduate of resting on her laurels. She made her name showing how the effects of climate change can be mitigated by ensuring the issue is at the heart of city planning. She and her firm Landprocess created the internationally acclaimed Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park, a four-hectare space in central Bangkok, which tilts downward at a three-degree angle, allowing rainwater to flow through the flanking grass and wetlands. Water that's not absorbed by the plants runs down to a pond at the base of the park, where it can be stored and filtered for use during dry spells or released gradually. In cases of severe flooding, the park can hold up to a million gallons of water. Global rising star  Kotchakorn rails against Bangkok's unchecked development - more than 10 million live in the metropolis packed with skyscrapers, factories, malls and hotels - warning that an ""addiction to growth"" at all costs is jeopardizing its ability to thrive. ""We think about how we're going to have more growth in our annual development... What if we shift the orientation from growth to really consider our actions on the environment, listen to the land more,"" she says. ""It doesn't mean I am against development but I want it to be very meaningful, very mindful, and at the right pace - so we don't actually kill our future."" Today her ideas have been embraced at home, and abroad - she gave an acclaimed TED talk in 2018, and last year TIME Magazine included her in its ""100 Next"" list of global rising stars. But convincing clients, authorities, and other businesses to see the big environmental picture has not been easy in a mega-city obsessed with economic targets and expansion. Driving change as a woman in a patriarchal society has been an additional challenge, but Kotchakorn insists there is ""power"" in being different, particularly in an industry dominated by older men offering only ""conventional ways of thinking."" Many of her ideas were initially dismissed, but she held firm, explaining, ""I feel that was based on their fear. But it's not my fear."" ""Women offer different kinds of judgement, different kinds of attitude towards problems... We have to bring that diversity to the table and create better decisions,"" she adds. Things must change  A turning point came in 2011, when Thailand endured its worst floods in half a century, which left more than 800 dead nationwide with hundreds of thousands displaced. Bangkok, built on once-marshy land and surrounded by natural waterways, was hard hit. Then came the World Bank warning that 40 percent of it would be inundated by 2030. It was clear then things needed to change, says Voraakhom, who grew up in the capital and says air quality has deteriorated rapidly, as has food quality and security because of the heavy use of pesticides. In 2018, she created Asia's largest rooftop farm, which mimics the region's famed rice terraces where run-off travels down layers of crops, conserving both water and soil. Winding around the 22,400 square-meter rooftop is a jogging path and a lawn. Later this year she will unveil plans to transform a vast, unused bridge crossing the Chao Phraya river into a park with bicycle lanes, bringing more green space to a place with precious little of it. ""If you just do a normal building, it's just going to be the same. It's just another building. But if you create, you actually could touch and change their way of living, their way of eating, their way of understanding of sustainability."" Kotchakorn has even greater ambitions for the city she grew up in - she wants to  ""reclaim"" the more than 1,000 canals that snake through Bangkok that are currently used for sewage. ""Canals have so much life, so much potential to be public green space and a skeleton of the whole city,"" she explains. Hailing her late mother as her inspiration, and her 11-year-old daughter as her motivation, she hopes her work will solve problems for generations to come. She says, ""Being a mother is really helping to push me to create hope and solutions for the next generation. You see that the things you build will last after your life.""

              HOME >> WORLD    Coronavirus spread parks soul-searching over travel-heavy climate change diplomacy    Source:Reuters Published: 2020/3/24 18:43:40           Delegates shake hands after the closing plenary session of the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid, Spain on December 15, 2019. Photo: AFP As the coronavirus began spreading quickly around the world, the Green Climate Fund, which backs developing-world projects to tackle climate change, relocated a board meeting this month from its headquarters in virus-hit South Korea to Switzerland. But at the opening of the three-day gathering in Geneva, France's delegate warned that holding the face-to-face meeting was too risky, and ""a mistake."" The following week, three people who attended - two of the fund's staff, based in South Korea, and an official from Liberia's Environmental Protection Agency - tested positive for the COVID-19 infection, though no other cases have since been detected. The Green Climate Fund said on Friday it was ""working closely with public health officials and the authorities"" in Switzerland, South Korea and other countries ""to take necessary steps to limit the risks of exposure and transmission of COVID-19."" It shut its headquarters in Incheon so the building could be disinfected, while its next board meeting, tentatively set for June, is ""under constant review,"" a spokesperson said by email. The incident highlights the dilemma facing a global community of bureaucrats, UN agencies, development banks and others trying to step up action on climate change in what analysts say is a critical year for the 2015 Paris Agreement . The roughly 195 countries and regions that adopted the Paris pact agreed to submit new or revised national climate action plans in 2020, with the expectation that they would include more ambitious targets to cut planet-heating emissions faster and further this decade. But the speed at which the coronavirus pandemic has forced the cancellation or postponement of in-person meetings around the world - including those organized by the UN climate secretariat (UNFCCC), until at least the end of April - has cast a dark shadow over collective efforts to tackle global warming. Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based climate and energy think tank, said he believed it was still too early to decide on delaying the annual two-week UN climate summit due to be held in Scotland in November. ""That would mean action on climate change gets ignored this year, and poor people on the frontlines can't afford that,"" he said. ""I would hate COVID-19 being used by [climate] laggards ... as their get-out-of-jail free card."" 'Creative' The UNFCCC, which runs global climate negotiations, may have no choice but to call off or slim down mid-year talks planned for early June in Bonn and considered key to advancing the agenda. For now, nothing is settled. But in mid-March, UN climate chief Patricia Espinosa said the secretariat was ""exploring the most advantageous and creative ways, through remote work and modern technology, to ensure our ongoing support to the intergovernmental process on climate change."" A spokesperson for the British government said it was continuing to work toward hosting the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, still nearly eight months away. But it was keeping the situation ""under careful review"" and was in frequent contact with the United Nations and other event partners, including Italy, now at the center of the pandemic. ""COVID-19 is clearly reducing the scope for in-person international meetings, which we will seek to manage as far as possible through other means such as video and phone conferences,"" she added. While running diplomacy and smaller meetings remotely may be an option, at least in the coming weeks, Adow said he saw ""no chance"" of doing the same for big international gatherings like the COP summits, which can attract as many as 30,000 delegates. There was a need for officials, civil society advocates and others to be in the same place to shape and respond to the quick flow of decision-making, he noted. As a climate and development expert from Kenya, he has pushed for agreements to meet the needs of poor and marginalized communities suffering the impacts of extreme weather and rising seas - something that could be sacrificed by unequal access to technology if negotiations go online, he warned. Anna Schulz, who works on climate policy with least-developed countries for the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, said holding conference calls across continents posed logistical challenges - from different time zones to poor internet access in some countries. Some African government officials tasked with climate diplomacy cannot get online in their offices or the connection quality is not good enough to enable them to participate in a meeting that could last several days, she noted. ""So you're looking at the possibility of having to fly delegates to a regional hub, like Kenya - but then that increases the potential for them to be exposed to the virus, and places an additional burden on the most vulnerable voices in the negotiations,"" she said. Such concerns were echoed at the recent Green Climate Fund session by diplomats from Egypt and Ecuador, who said it would be very difficult for them to join online board meetings and other options should be considered. Action on the ground Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said the time had come to consider new ways of organizing the international climate process to reduce its high carbon footprint and complex logistics, but still get the work done. ""We need to be thinking innovatively about making these kinds of global meetings more efficient in terms of the outcomes and less dependent on thousands of people from all over the world flying into one city,"" he said. Instead of holding the annual UN summit in a different country each time, smaller-scale government negotiations could take place once a year in a set city where most countries keep high-level diplomatic staff who could represent them, such as New York, Washington DC or Bonn, he said. Other participants - including green groups, businesses, city officials, indigenous people and researchers - could still influence the proceedings from afar, he added, pointing to the success of worldwide youth protests in driving climate change up the political agenda. With the overarching international guidance for tackling global warming set back in 2015, the main task now was to accelerate the unfinished work of phasing out fossil fuels and protecting people from climate impacts on the ground, said Huq, a veteran advisor to poorer nations.

The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the opening of the General Debate of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York, September 24, 2019. File photo: Xinhua ""We should not overestimate the fact that emissions have been reduced for some months. We will not fight climate change with the virus,"" he said. ""It is important that all the attention that needs to be given to fight this disease does not distract us from the need to defeat climate change,"" he said. Guterres was speaking after the publication of a UN report on planetary warming in 2019, and said the situation demanded urgent action. ""Global heating is accelerating,"" he said as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN institution, presented its update. The WMO report confirmed findings in December that 2019 was the second hottest year on record, ""with the past decade the hottest in human history,"" Guterres said. ""We have no time to lose if we are to avert climate catastrophe,"" Guterres emphasized. ""Let us have no illusions. Climate change is already causing calamity, and more is to come."" The WMO report looked at different aspects of climate change, from the accelerating sea level rise due to melting ice to changes in land and marine ecosystems. The planet will continue to warm up if greenhouse gases continue to increase, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. ""We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonably mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere,"" Taalas said. ""Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in CO2 emissions,"" he said. ""This is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas.""

              HOME >> WORLD    UN celebrates Women's Day, envisages Generation Equality    Source:Xinhua Published: 2020/3/7 17:17:18           Students and teachers participate in a campaign calling for the end of violence against women and children, on the occasion of Valentine's Day in Manila, the Philippines, Feb. 14, 2020. (Xinhua/Rouelle Umali) The United Nations (UN) on Friday celebrated the Internatioanl Women's Day in an observance that called for more headway in women's rights toward Generation Equality. The observance, themed ""I am Generation Equality: Realizing women's rights,"" saw the participation of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin, and Nobel Peace Laureate Leymah Gbowee. ""Gender inequality is the overwhelming injustice of this age and the biggest human rights challenge the world faces,"" said Guterres at the observance. Recalling his own words ""gender equality is a question of power,"" the UN chief said that men have used and abused power to control women and prevent them from achieving their potential for thousands of years, and deep-rooted patriarchy and misogyny have created a yawning gender power gap in economies, political systems, corporations, societies and culture. He said in recent months, high-profile peace agreements have been signed without any women at the table, and emergency healthcare meetings on the novel coronavirus were convened with few or no women, despite that women make up the majority of the healthcare workforce. On a positive note, the secretary-general pointed to changes in recent years. He cited women's movements that are protesting femicide, demanding equal pay, and calling out powerful men for violence and abuse. In particular, he said, young women are redefining what power looks like. ""They are creating new, inclusive forms of leadership that unite people across borders and around common goals."" Addressing the young leaders in the audience, Guterres said ""we need your passion and conviction as we face a whole range of global challenges, from climate change to conflict."" ""Generation Equality cannot be Generation Gradual Improvement or Generation Incremental Change. Generation Equality means equal rights and opportunities for all women and girls, now,"" he said, shedding light on the theme of the observance. Marin, for her part, said that the world cannot achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out in the 2030 Agenda without achieving SDG5 -- gender equality. The female leader said as the UN launched a Decade of Action for the SDGs, the world needs to ensure that every human being has their rights respected and can reach their full potential for the goals to be fulfilled. As the world's youngest serving prime minister, 34-year-old Marin said: ""We, as world leaders, have all the tools needed to make changes that secure the future we want,"" demonstrating her commitment to Generation Equality. She went on to lament that the number of female heads of state and government is only 21, while there are 193 UN member states and more than half of the global population are women and girls. Taking pride in her country's lead in gender equality, she recalled that Finland was the first country in the world to grant women full political rights, both the right to vote and the right to run for office. Currently, women lead all the five parties in Finland coalition government and four of those leaders are under the age of 35. However, Marin underscored that no country in the world has achieved gender equality, and ""Finland is no exception,"" noting that the Nordic country faces inequalities in the labor market and violence against women and girls, which she proposed policy solutions to tackle. UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande asked everyone, everywhere to uphold gender equality as a necessity in upholding human rights. Twenty-five years since the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action, which remains the most comprehensive global agenda for achieving gender equality, all UN member states should work assiduously to implement it, he said in a video message for the observance. ""We have made important gains since 1995: there are more girls in school than ever before, and many countries have reached gender parity in educational enrolment. However, no country can claim to have achieved gender equality, especially in terms of income and political leadership,"" he said. Change has been slow for most women and girls in the world and there is much work to do, said Muhammad-Bande. UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who made closing remarks for the event, said ""women only occupy 25 percent of the space in power and in places of influence,"" citing a newly-released report by her office. Mlambo-Ngcuka said, ""75 percent of the parliamentary seats are held by men, 73 percent of managerial positions are held by man, and 70 percent of climate negotiators are men."" ""So there's the 25 percent that we're being squeezed into today. We are breaking out. We want too much the 50 percent, and we want to work together to achieve that 50 percent,"" said the UN Women chief. She said the new report also shows that change is possible. ""If you were not pushing against the pushback, things would be much worse. So we cannot and should not be discouraged. It has to be forward ever, and backward never."" The 64th session the Commission on the Status of Women, set to be held here Monday, will adopt a political declaration to reaffirm the international commitment to improving women's rights, Mlambo-Ngcuka added.

** UN to hold shortened session on women's rights - Global Times **

* https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1182055.shtml *

              HOME >> WORLD    UN to hold shortened session on women’s rights    Source:AFP Published: 2020/3/9 21:03:40           Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres makes a special talk on sustainable development and climate change in Islamabad, Pakistan, on February 16. File photo: Xinhua  The United Nations is expected Monday to adopt a stripped-down political declaration on women's rights that seeks to preserve gains under threat but does not advocate new ways to ensure progress toward equality. The matter is to be taken up during the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, which has been drastically reduced from a two-week affair to a single hours-long meeting because of the global coronavirus outbreak. Twelve thousand participants were originally set to take part. But Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged member states not to send delegations to New York, and to cancel debates and other events surrounding the meeting - the UN's second-largest each year after the General Assembly. The text set to be adopted follows the main lines of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of 1995, which sought to promote women's emancipation and advancement around the world. France plans to host a follow-up conference in July to be titled ""Beijing+25"" aimed at helping protect and ensure the gains women have made over the past quarter-century. ""The situation [of women] is actually not at all where we should be so many years after the Beijing meeting,"" said Olof Skoog, the European Union ambassador to the UN. ""This is not because there is a lack of focus,"" Skoog, who is Swedish, told journalists. ""It's actually because there is an active political pushback in many countries."" To ensure the declaration's success, negotiators eliminated any reference to reproductive health, opposed by US officials, diplomats said.

** UN: Climate change could put development goals beyond reach ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/climate-change-put-development-goals-reach-191030214313911.html *

UN official: With the planet heating up fast, so-called 'worthy' global goals may no longer be the best focus.
As global warming brings wilder weather, more harvest failures and the risk of growing migration and poverty, ""sustainable development as we think of it today may be out of reach"", a top United Nations specialist in climate change losses warned on Wednesday.
Nations around the world in 2015 agreed to pursue a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aiming to end poverty and hunger, as well as provide safe drinking water and affordable clean energy to all - among many other aims - by 2030.
But with the planet heating up fast, innumerable serious threats - from expanding cities facing rising seas to small islands watching their coral reefs die - mean those ""worthy"" global goals may no longer be the best focus, said Koko Warner of the UN climate change secretariat.
""These [climate] changes out in the world are in some cases unfolding at a pace that's a bit surprising,"" the economist told a conference on researching climate-related damage at Lund University in Sweden.
With Indonesia already planning to shift its flood-prone capital and other nations grappling with problems such as worsening water shortages, pushing to meet the SDGs could be a matter of ""trying to solve the problems of the 20th century"" even as grave new 21st-century challenges loom, she said.
Leaders and societies seeking to protect the wellbeing of their people may need to refocus on tougher issues, Warner added.
Those could include lifestyle changes people are willing to make to reduce climate risk and protect things they prize, such as securing their children's futures or being able to stay in their home nations rather than be forced to move.
""We need to understand what people value and what's acceptable or not,"" said Warner, who leads work on climate change impacts and risks for the UN climate body.
As more protesters take to the streets around the world, demanding faster climate action, governments will need to make policy shifts that are acceptable to both activists and the broader public - and ""that's a hard needle to thread"", she said.
Dealing with growing climate threats also might require reshaping international institutions, she added.
The UN climate secretariat, for instance, which oversaw the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, focuses primarily on national-level action on climate threats.
But with cities growing so fast - about 70 percent of the world's population will be urban by 2050, the UN predicts - much of the work to cut carbon emissions and build climate-safe infrastructure is happening at the city level, Warner said.
Today's international processes to fight climate change do not necessarily focus ""where action needs to occur"", she added.
Reinhard Mechler, a scientist who looks at the socioeconomic aspects of disasters and climate change, said discussions on climate-related losses will need to include damage to culture, traditions and heritage, as well as economies.
Already, there is a move to examine ""existential"" threats, said Mechler of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis based in Austria.
UN climate talks in 2013 established the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage, to explore ways of dealing with climate-related harm to people, property and nature.
That mechanism is up for review at the next round of UN climate talks, scheduled for December. But the venue for the COP25 conference is in the air, meanwhile, as Chile on Wednesday told the UN it cannot host due to political unrest.
Digging into the wider implications of climate losses is important now - as they have started to surge, Warner said.
From small islands facing a decline in tourism as coral reefs deteriorate, to Germany seeing its famed forests die off, ""we are talking about profound change,"" she noted.

Sudan is the world's main producer and exporter of gum arabic, according to the United Nations's food and agricultural organisation. It is used in many products from soft drinks to cosmetics and accounts for nearly 15 percent of Sudan's income.
But farmers who plant and harvest the product say they are worried that it is about to change.

** Why climate action needs to target the border industrial complex ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/climate-action-target-border-industrial-complex-191029104800226.html *


Climate change is displacing a growing number of people; governments are responding by privatising border policing.
In the last few months, all publicly known banking partners of the US private prison and immigrant detention leader GEO Group have committed to severing their ties with the industry. The banks' decision was a major win for campaigners and grassroots activists who have long been working to stop the flow of capital into companies profiting from the destructive combination of mass incarceration in the United States, more aggressive border control policies and increased migration flows exacerbated by climate change.
The survival of private prisons depends on keeping a consistent and increasing number of people incarcerated and today immigrants serve as this predatory industry's primary cash generators. According to a report by the New York Times, last year, private companies incarcerated about nine percent of the total US prison population, but 73 percent of immigrant detainees. 
Meanwhile, a growing body of evidence points to climate change being the ""silent driver"" behind the immigration from Central America and southern Mexico to the US. While violence, organised crime, systemic corruption and poverty, which in many ways are the result of a long history of US meddling and militarism in the region, are the most cited reasons for the exodus from South to North America, experts say climate change in the region is exacerbating - and sometimes causing - these problems, and forcing people to move.
The connection between displacement and climate change is not exclusive to the Americas.
Similarly, some researchers link Syria's devastating conflict, which displaced millions of people, to a drought made worse by climate change. The climate emergency in Africa's Lake Chad region is also believed to have contributed to the rise of Boko Haram - an armed group that has displaced over two million people. 
In other words, many of the displaced today - in the Americas, the Middle East and Africa alike - are being driven from their homes, at least in part, because of the destructive effects of climate change. And this seems to be just the beginning.
A new report by the Red Cross estimates that within 10 years, 150 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to the climate crisis. This builds upon alarming predictions from the World Bank and the UN's International Organization for Migration that there could be 143-200 million climate migrants by 2050. 
All this makes the fight against corporations, like GEO Group, that stand to profit from the expansion of the climate crisis even more urgent. And it is important to take action not only against private prisons and detention centres, and the corporations that run them, but also more generally against the growing global border-industrial complex which is feeding on the suffering and devastation caused by climate change.
Western governments from Washington to Canberra view the climate crisis through the lens of national security. Even though they are the primary cause behind global warming, they are constantly looking for ways to separate themselves from its consequences. 
This is why the world's biggest polluters - including the US, which has emitted more metric tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution than any other country since the Industrial Revolution - are constructing unprecedented border regimes. These governments are seeing climate migrants not as people but ""security threats"" and heavily investing in private companies that are promising to eliminate this threat using walls, bullets, drones and cages. 
Thanks to the Western fear of migrants and unwillingness to come up with a sustainable and humane solution to the climate crisis, this border-industrial complex has grown strong enough to help shape national immigration policies and fuel militarisation and human rights abuses across the world.
The US' dependence on this industry has reached the point where its budget for border and immigration control has gone up more than 15-fold in the last 25 years and increased by an astonishing 133,567 percent since 1980. 
We are seeing similar trends elsewhere in the world. In 2009, the European market for border control security was estimated to be between 6 and 8 billion euros ($7-9bn). Today, this market is estimated to reach 50 billion euros globally ($57bn) by 2022.
The expanding reach of this mercenary industry into security, surveillance and detention operations across the Western world has implications for the freedom and rights of everyone, not only the millions who are forced to seek sanctuary in these countries for reasons beyond their control.
For those in the West, it means that private corporations focused on financial gain will be increasingly responsible for policing. For migrants and refugees, it means facing more exclusionary border policies and violence. There will be more walls and detention centres and more impunity for repressive tactics, delivered through a suite of corporate service providers gearing up to profit from abusive responses to the climate crisis. 
This expanding ""border industrial complex"" is the nexus between border policing, militarisation and financial interest. It is the product of Western governments that are unwilling to respond humanely to a crisis of their own making.
This is why, in the aftermath of the largest international mobilisation around climate inaction, the movement must turn its attention to the human rights abuses linked to climate-induced displacement and migration.
We cannot resign ourselves to a climate future defined by walls, bullets, drones, cops and cages. The banks' decision to sever ties with the GEO group is proof that grassroots campaigns can bring meaningful change. We now need to expand our efforts to bring down the entire border-industrial complex.

** World mayors in Copenhagen pledge 'to do something about ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/world-mayors-copenhagen-pledge-climate-191011221247492.html *

City governments commit to work with young activists on implementing policies that cut carbon emissions more quickly. 
With activists such as Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and advocates in the Extinction Rebellion movement taking an increasingly visible stand on climate change, public officials feel growing pressure to respond, mayors gathered in Copenhagen said on Friday.
Young protesters demonstrating across the world are driving cities to step up action on global warming, not least because politicians keep coming face-to-face with them while going about their business, city leaders from Seattle to Freetown told an international climate conference held in the capital of Denmark.
""If you want to walk the streets of some of the biggest cities in Poland, you've got to do something about climate change,"" Warsaw's mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, told the C40 World Mayors Summit.
""The pressure, especially from young people, is just enormous,"" he said. ""They are fed up with declarations, with goals and priorities...They want to see results.""
Leaders of more than 90 cities representing more than 700 million people and a quarter of the global economy met in the Danish capital this week to push for faster action to stem climate threats.
C40 Cities connects 94 of the world's major cities to take bold climate action towards a healthier and more sustainable future.
On Friday, the mayors promised to create a Global Youth Initiative to help deliver a Global Green New Deal.
""It is not even about a specific piece of legislation, it is about a global change of values, ideals, and ways of relating to each other and the Earth,"" said Jamie Margolin, Zero Hour founder and co-executive director.
The gathering came as Extinction Rebellion activists took to the streets from London to New Zealand for two weeks of peaceful civil disobedience.
""Mayors are on the frontline now,"" former United States Vice President Al Gore told the conference. ""You do not have the luxury of just going away and reading reports about what is going on. You run into your constituents every single day.""
On Thursday Extinction Rebellion attempted to shut down London City Airport, with one protester lying on top of a plane. On Friday they blocked the headquarters of the BBC, the public service broadcaster in the United Kingdom.
Earlier this week, members of the movement in France blocked a street and bridge in Paris' Chatelet district. The city's mayor and C40 chair, Anne Hidalgo, said she shared their concern.
""We are facing threats of climate breakdown – the response that we're seeing from Extinction Rebellion and young climate strikers around the globe should come as no surprise,"" she said.
""As mayors, it is our duty, responsibility and privilege to support them in creating the future they want.""
In Copenhagen, city leaders unveiled a series of pledges and measures to cut planet-warming emissions, from reducing meat consumption to tackling air pollution with cheap bus fares and vehicle bans.
But delegates at the summit opening on Wednesday were met by demonstrators from Klima Aktion DK, a local climate action group, armed with fake binoculars made from toilet rolls.
""Our message to the C40 Mayors is: The people are watching you! We want to see action!"" the group wrote on Facebook.
Cities are vital to limit global warming as they account for about three-quarters of carbon emissions and consume more than two-thirds of global energy, according to the United Nations.
Wider use of existing clean technologies - such as electric buses - could deliver more than half the cuts needed to keep global temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the UN says.
World leaders agreed in the 2015 Paris agreement to hold temperate hikes to ""well below"" that threshold.
""Cities are where the climate battle will largely be won or lost,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Copenhagen summit.
Hilda Nakabuye, the founder of Fridays for Future in Uganda, said her family had been forced to sell its land and livestock as heavy rains, high winds and dry spells linked to climate change had wiped away crops and made the soil barren.
""Your beds might be comfortable right now but not for long. You'll soon feel the same heat that we feel every day,"" she warned.
Many mayors in attendance said they were inspired by the resolve shown by young activists - and somewhat surprised by the rapid growth of their movement.
Milan's mayor Giuseppe Sala said the city council was planning to consult young people in climate matters. But translating ideas into concrete action was not always easy, as not everybody agreed on what should be done, said the mayor of Lisbon, Fernando Medina.
Even simple measures such as creating more cycle lanes often faced opposition from residents and politicians when, for example, they encroached on parking spaces, he said.
""I don't have a magic wand,"" he said. ""But I can tell [young people] that I can work every day to make things happen more quickly"".
Others lamented that cities alone could not solve the climate crisis. ""Cities are leading the change, but countries need to do their part too,"" said the mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau.
At least 70 countries announced plans at the UN Climate Action Summit last month to boost efforts to cut emissions, but most major economies, including the United States and China, failed to announce stronger new measures.

** What is really behind the crisis in Haiti? | Environment | Al Jazeera **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/crisis-haiti-190927092336787.html *


Decades of neoliberalism, neocolonialism and now climate injustice have pushed Haiti to the brink.
For months now, Haiti has been shaken by intensifying protests. A deepening economic crisis and growing fuel and food shortages have sent people to the streets, demanding the resignation of US-backed President Jovenel Moise, who has so far resisted stepping down.
The crisis started last year and was compounded by natural disasters that have repeatedly devastated the island nation: Hurricanes destroyed housing, food production, livelihoods and infrastructure and a severe drought dried up the island's water resources.
While international media has focused on a familiar story of corruption and mismanagement, what lies beneath this debilitating crisis is much more serious - a deadly combination of neocolonialism, neoliberalism and climate injustice. Indeed, what is happening now in Haiti is extreme and should scare us all, as it foreshadows what could happen to the rest of the planet if we do not take immediate action.
In January 2006, Haiti joined the Venezuelan solidarity programme Petrocaribe, which supplied it with oil under favourable terms. The country was able to buy 60,000 barrels a day at a discounted price, with half the costs repayable over 25 years at a one-percent interest rate in cash, or in exchange for goods Haiti exported.
This was supposed to free up resources for economic development initiatives in infrastructure and boost agricultural production. However, large-scale corruption swallowed billions of dollars of profit the programme earned the government, while at the same time amassing a growing debt to Venezuela.
With the Venezuelan economy in tatters, Caracas had to stop oil shipments in March 2018, which triggered fuel shortages in Haiti. The crisis was compounded by the government's move in July that year to remove energy subsidies, which increased fuel prices by more than 50 percent.
The decision was taken under pressure from the International Monetary Fund - which promised a $96m financial loan package to help the country repay its debt - and the G20 and international agencies, which have been calling for an end to fuel subsidies. The move also reflected Haiti's policy commitments under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 31 percent by 2030.
The cut off of oil supplies through the Petrocaribe programme also forced the Haitian government to turn to the global market - in particular, US-based energy supplier Novum Energy Corp - to supply fuel. As the government has fallen further into debt - now owing some $130m to fuel suppliers - shortages worsened.
By succumbing to international pressure to cut subsidies, the Haitian government accommodated foreign agendas but endangered the survival of its own population. The country produces just 0.02 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and yet its people are paying a disproportionate price for abiding by international financial standards and emission controls.
Fuel subsidies amounted to just 2.2 percent of Haiti's GDP and were one way in which the government was able to support impoverished citizens, still struggling after the massive 2010 earthquake and the consequences of yearly natural disasters.
After the recent hurricanes, many communities were left off the grid and fuel has been badly needed to run electricity generators. The economy of the country has also been devastated, with most people employed in the informal sector and highly dependent on having access to cheaper fuel.
Indeed, these energy subsidies were providing much-needed support to over 6 million impoverished Haitians who live on $2.41 a day.
Since mid-2018, the crisis has progressively gotten worse and, recently, protests against the government have intensified.
It is clear to anyone who visits Haiti today that austerity measures and ""free market"" forces cannot resolve the problems of a country facing the worst effects of climate change, government dysfunction, donor corruption, and a never-ending debt crisis. 
At the same time, despite making efforts to divest from fossil fuels and despite being ranked among the top three countries most vulnerable to climate change, Haiti has struggled with climate action; its efforts lack focus and are mostly driven by international donors.
For example, according to research I did last year, the country is struggling to access finance allocated through global initiatives like the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Bureaucratic barriers and onerous criteria are making it almost impossible for the government to tap into these resources. 
This has prevented the country from building its climate resilience and, now, with every natural disaster that strikes, it has to rely on short-term handouts by international aid agencies to manage its consequences. 
The Haitian crisis is very much the product of the toxic combination of colonialism, neoliberalism and an unjust approach to tackling climate change.
The environmental degradation, which is exacerbated with each drought and hurricane season, goes back to French colonial rule over Haiti when land and forests were abused, rendering large swathes of the country barren and infertile.
After Haiti managed to liberate itself from French colonial rule in the early 19th century, it fell within the growing US sphere of influence and has been unable to set itself free ever since. The US not only occupied the country for nearly two decades and repeatedly interfered in its affairs, but today it is also supporting a highly unpopular president whose resignation protesters continue to demand. 
While preventing the Haitian people from holding their politicians accountable and fighting corruption, Washington has also been imposing neoliberal policies on the country, which have fed into its economic crisis. 
The US approach to the Haitian economy has been predominantly extractive. The country has an estimated $20bn of mineral deposits exploited mostly by US and Canadian corporations. 
It is time the world starts paying attention to what is going on in Haiti because its crisis illustrates what would happen to the rest of the world if neoliberal and neocolonial policies continue to dominate the global economy.
Haitians have now woken up to the idea that US-styled free-market economics will only worsen its mounting crisis in the face of climate change and underdevelopment. 
They have been fighting back on their own, fully aware that their domestic elites will not address their concerns and are only able to remain in power because of US intervention. 
Up to this point, the international climate action movement has completely ignored what has been going on in Haiti. While calls for a global green new deal are commendable, they cannot disregard the continuous climate injustice befalling places like Haiti.
If it is indeed going to be a ""new"" deal, then it cannot follow the paternalistic ""we know what is best for you"" approach. It needs to account for realities on the ground in the Global South, so it does not cause more harm than good.
A transition to a new energy system can only be successful if it acknowledges the power the Global North still has over the South and the need for climate justice. 
Climate action can only bring about a new, sustainable status quo if it recognises the agency and experience of developing countries and indigenous, working-class and peasant movements, and builds upon this knowledge. 
In Haiti, support has to be extended to black working-class Haitians, who constitute the majority of the population, and their basic needs met. Popular protests and their demands have to be backed and an accountability process facilitated. 
The country also needs significant no-strings-attached investment carried out under anti-corruption scrutiny to help pull its economy away from extractivism and resource-export dependence and put it on a course towards green development. Only then can the process of building climate resilience start under the leadership of Haitians themselves.
Indeed, Haiti will be the first big test for the transnational climate justice movement. If it fails to deliver climate justice to the Haitians, then its global green new deal is doomed to failure.

** UN chief warns of 'point of no return' on climate change | News | Al ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/chief-warns-point-return-climate-change-191202054803750.html *

Antonio Guterres said effect of rising temperatures is already being felt around the world.
The world's efforts to stop climate change have been ""utterly inadequate"" so far and there is a danger that global warming could pass the ""point of no return"", United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said.
Speaking before the start on Monday of a two-week international climate conference in Spain, the UN chief said the effect of rising temperatures - including more extreme weather - is already being felt around the world with dramatic consequences for humans and other species.
The COP25 talks in Madrid will focus on finalising rules for global carbon markets and setting up a fund to help countries already reeling from climate change - enhanced heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms made worse by rising seas. 
Guterres noted the world has the scientific knowledge and the technical means to limit global warming, but ""what is lacking is political will"". 
""The point of no return is no longer over the horizon,"" Guterres told reporters in the Spanish capital. ""It is in sight and hurtling toward us.""
Guterres cited mounting scientific evidence for the impact that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are already having on the planet, including record temperatures and melting polar ice.
But he insisted his message was ""one of hope, not of despair"".
""Our war against nature must stop and we know that is possible,"" he said.
Countries agreed in Paris four years ago to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times.
Guterres noted some 70 countries - many among the most vulnerable to climate change - have pledged to stop emitting more greenhouse gases by 2050.
""But we also see clearly that the world's largest emitters are not pulling their weight. And without them, our goal is unreachable,"" he said. 
The UN chief said he hoped the meeting in Madrid would see governments make more ambitious pledges ahead of a deadline to do so next year.
""Some countries like China and Japan are signalling their unwillingness to increase ambition,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation - and a main architect of the Paris Agreement. 
United States President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris deal entirely, formally notifying the UN in November this year of his government's intentions. 
Organisers expect about 29,000 visitors, including some 50 heads of state and government for Monday's opening, as well as scientists, seasoned negotiators, and activists during the two-week meeting.
More than 5,000 police officers are in charge of keeping the summit safe, Spain's Ministry of Interior said on Sunday.
Although authorities have stepped-up border controls and cybersecurity measures, authorities have kept the country's security alert one level under the highest, where it has been ever since attacks in Tunisia and France in mid-2015.

** Climate change: 11,000 scientists warn of 'untold suffering' | News ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/climate-change-11000-scientists-warn-untold-suffering-191106055959807.html *

Climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected, signatories say. 
More than 11,000 scientists have ""clearly and unequivocally"" declared a climate emergency that could bring ""untold suffering"" unless there are significant transformations in the way humans live. 
""Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any great existential threat,"" the signatories, who hail from 153 countries, said in a paper published in BioScience magazine on Tuesday.
""To secure a sustainable future, we must change how we live ... [This] entails major transformations in the ways our global society functions and interacts with natural ecosystems.""
The signatories suggest six steps that would lessen the worst effects of climate change: replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon renewables; reducing the emissions of pollutants such as methane; protecting the Earth's ecosystems; eating mostly plant-based foods and fewer animal products; creating a carbon-free economy and stabilising the human population.
In their statement, the alliance of scientists, led by William Ripple and Christopher Wolf of Oregon State University in the United States, said the climate crisis is ""accelerating faster"" than most researchers expected.
""Despite 40 years of global climate negotiations, with few exceptions, we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament,"" they wrote.
""Especially worrisome are potential irreversible climate tipping points and nature's reinforcing feedbacks (atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial) that could lead to a catastrophic 'hothouse Earth', well beyond the control of humans,"" they said.
The scientists say they are ""encouraged by a recent surge of concern"" over the climate crisis, demonstrated by the student-led Fridays for Future movement and other grassroots campaigns.
""As the Alliance of World Scientists, we stand ready to assist decision-makers in a just transition to a sustainable and equitable future,"" the paper concludes, adding that humanity should ""act to sustain life on planet Earth, our only home"".
Thomas Newsome, one of the authors of the report, said that even though some of the effects of climate change are already evident, the scientists still believe there is time to reduce greenhouse gase emissions ""and hopefully change the trajectory of the graphical indicators that we presented in the paper"".Small individual changes that people make in their day-to-day lives, such as reducing meat consumption,  reducing air travel and using renewable enerfy sources are going to make ""larger scale impacts,"" Newsome told Al Jazeera from Sydney.
""It's also going to influence policy makers, business communities and governments to really start taking the much bigger steps that are needed at a global scale to tackle this problem of climate change.  ""All of the indicators in our paper are heading in the wrong direction and we are clear in advocating for global action against - what we are calling - a climate emergency.""
The letter's publication comes one day after US President Donald Trump begun the process to quit Washington's participation in the landmark Paris climate accord, which seeks to fight climate change by mutual reductions in climate emissions.
Washington presented its withdrawal letter to the United Nations on Monday, the first possible date under the accord negotiated by Trump's predecessor Barack Obama, making the world's largest economy the sole outlier from the agreement.
But Chinese President Xi Jinping and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, declared on Wednesday that the Paris climate pact is ""irreversible"".
Key powers expressed regret and concern after Trump went ahead with the pullout despite mounting evidence of the reality and effect of climate change.
In a joint statement released after Xi and Macron held talks in Beijing, the two leaders reaffirmed ""their firm support for the Paris accord which they consider as an irreversible process and a compass for strong action on climate"".
Without directly naming the US, Macron said he ""deplores the choices made by others"" as he sat next to Xi following the talks.

** Why climate action needs to target the border industrial complex ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/climate-action-target-border-industrial-complex-191029104800226.html *


Climate change is displacing a growing number of people; governments are responding by privatising border policing.
In the last few months, all publicly known banking partners of the US private prison and immigrant detention leader GEO Group have committed to severing their ties with the industry. The banks' decision was a major win for campaigners and grassroots activists who have long been working to stop the flow of capital into companies profiting from the destructive combination of mass incarceration in the United States, more aggressive border control policies and increased migration flows exacerbated by climate change.
The survival of private prisons depends on keeping a consistent and increasing number of people incarcerated and today immigrants serve as this predatory industry's primary cash generators. According to a report by the New York Times, last year, private companies incarcerated about nine percent of the total US prison population, but 73 percent of immigrant detainees. 
Meanwhile, a growing body of evidence points to climate change being the ""silent driver"" behind the immigration from Central America and southern Mexico to the US. While violence, organised crime, systemic corruption and poverty, which in many ways are the result of a long history of US meddling and militarism in the region, are the most cited reasons for the exodus from South to North America, experts say climate change in the region is exacerbating - and sometimes causing - these problems, and forcing people to move.
The connection between displacement and climate change is not exclusive to the Americas.
Similarly, some researchers link Syria's devastating conflict, which displaced millions of people, to a drought made worse by climate change. The climate emergency in Africa's Lake Chad region is also believed to have contributed to the rise of Boko Haram - an armed group that has displaced over two million people. 
In other words, many of the displaced today - in the Americas, the Middle East and Africa alike - are being driven from their homes, at least in part, because of the destructive effects of climate change. And this seems to be just the beginning.
A new report by the Red Cross estimates that within 10 years, 150 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to the climate crisis. This builds upon alarming predictions from the World Bank and the UN's International Organization for Migration that there could be 143-200 million climate migrants by 2050. 
All this makes the fight against corporations, like GEO Group, that stand to profit from the expansion of the climate crisis even more urgent. And it is important to take action not only against private prisons and detention centres, and the corporations that run them, but also more generally against the growing global border-industrial complex which is feeding on the suffering and devastation caused by climate change.
Western governments from Washington to Canberra view the climate crisis through the lens of national security. Even though they are the primary cause behind global warming, they are constantly looking for ways to separate themselves from its consequences. 
This is why the world's biggest polluters - including the US, which has emitted more metric tonnes of greenhouse gas pollution than any other country since the Industrial Revolution - are constructing unprecedented border regimes. These governments are seeing climate migrants not as people but ""security threats"" and heavily investing in private companies that are promising to eliminate this threat using walls, bullets, drones and cages. 
Thanks to the Western fear of migrants and unwillingness to come up with a sustainable and humane solution to the climate crisis, this border-industrial complex has grown strong enough to help shape national immigration policies and fuel militarisation and human rights abuses across the world.
The US' dependence on this industry has reached the point where its budget for border and immigration control has gone up more than 15-fold in the last 25 years and increased by an astonishing 133,567 percent since 1980. 
We are seeing similar trends elsewhere in the world. In 2009, the European market for border control security was estimated to be between 6 and 8 billion euros ($7-9bn). Today, this market is estimated to reach 50 billion euros globally ($57bn) by 2022.
The expanding reach of this mercenary industry into security, surveillance and detention operations across the Western world has implications for the freedom and rights of everyone, not only the millions who are forced to seek sanctuary in these countries for reasons beyond their control.
For those in the West, it means that private corporations focused on financial gain will be increasingly responsible for policing. For migrants and refugees, it means facing more exclusionary border policies and violence. There will be more walls and detention centres and more impunity for repressive tactics, delivered through a suite of corporate service providers gearing up to profit from abusive responses to the climate crisis. 
This expanding ""border industrial complex"" is the nexus between border policing, militarisation and financial interest. It is the product of Western governments that are unwilling to respond humanely to a crisis of their own making.
This is why, in the aftermath of the largest international mobilisation around climate inaction, the movement must turn its attention to the human rights abuses linked to climate-induced displacement and migration.
We cannot resign ourselves to a climate future defined by walls, bullets, drones, cops and cages. The banks' decision to sever ties with the GEO group is proof that grassroots campaigns can bring meaningful change. We now need to expand our efforts to bring down the entire border-industrial complex.

** Climate change exposes children to lifelong health harm: Doctors ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/climate-change-exposes-children-lifelong-health-harm-doctors-191114065305748.html *

A new study says impacts of climate change could burden an entire generation with disease and illness.
A child born today will face multiple and lifelong dangers to their health from climate change as growing up in a warmer world risks food shortages, infectious diseases, floods and extreme heat, a major global study has found.
Climate change is already harming people's health by increasing the number of extreme weather events and exacerbating air pollution, according to an annual study published on Thursday in The Lancet medical journal.
The study warned that if nothing is done to mitigate climate change, its impacts could burden an entire generation with disease and illness throughout their lives.
""Children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks of a changing climate. Their bodies and immune systems are still developing, leaving them more susceptible to disease and environmental pollutants,"" said Nick Watts, who co-led The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change study.
He warned that health damage in early childhood is ""persistent and pervasive"", and carries lifelong consequences.
""Without immediate action from all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, gains in wellbeing and life expectancy will be compromised, and climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation,"" he told a London briefing.
Yet introducing policies to limit emissions and cap global warming would see a different outcome, the research team said.
In that scenario, a child born today would see an end to coal use in the United Kingdom, for example, by their sixth birthday and the world reaching net-zero emissions by the time they were 31.
It will take the work of the 7.5 billion people currently alive to ensure the health of a child born today is not defined by a changing climate. Read the @LancetCountdown 2019 report on the state of #health & #climatechange across the 🌎 https://t.co/n58gAE6y4v #LancetClimate19
The Lancet study is a collaboration by 120 experts from 35 institutions including the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, University College London and China's Tsinghua University.
On a ""business-as-usual"" pathway, with little action to limit climate change, it found that amid rising temperatures and extreme weather events, children would be vulnerable to malnutrition and rising food prices and the most likely to suffer from warmer waters and climates accelerating the spread of infectious diseases such as dengue fever and cholera.
Already, the number of days when conditions are ripe for the spread of the water-borne bacteria Vibrio, a major cause of debilitating diarrhoea, have doubled since 1980, with last year ranking as the second-highest on record.
Meanwhile, nine of the top 10 years where conditions were most ripe for dengue fever transmission have occurred since 2000, the report said.
Among the most immediate and long-lasting health threats from climate change is air pollution, the researchers said.
They called for urgent action to reduce outdoor and indoor pollution through the introduction of cleaner fuels and vehicles, and policies to encourage safe and active transport such as walking and cycling.
The WHO says that in 2016, seven million deaths globally were due to the effects of household and ambient air pollution. The vast majority of these were in low and middle-income countries.
""If we want to protect our children, we need to make sure the air they breathe isn't toxic,"" said Sonja Ayeb-Karlsson, a global health specialist at the UK's Sussex University who worked on the Lancet study.

The protest movement calling for action on climate has gained momentum this year with millions taking to the streets across the world demanding that governments do more to fix the crisis.
Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg gained widespread attention for her ""you have stolen my childhood"" speech at the UN climate action summit in September.
The environmental protest movement Extinction Rebellion launched dramatic protests in the UK and across the world. India's capital New Delhi made headlines after its pollution levels became so bad that the city announced a public health emergency and closed schools.
The EU meanwhile declared a global ""climate and environmental emergency"". The United Nations released multiple reports warning of the dangers of climate change. While in the US, the climate crisis emerged as one of the issues among Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Indigenous Mexican-American activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez has been campaigning against climate change since he was six years old. He says now, more than ever, Indigenous voices are being recognised.
""Every part of the crisis is directly connected to social justice, to racial justice, to the human rights violations that are happening ... and now, more than ever, there is a recognition of the need of indigenous communities' voices being at the forefront,"" Martinez said.
Martinez, along with 20 other activists, is suing the US federal government for climate inaction.
He was also involved in another lawsuit against the fracking industry in Colorado, a case he lost. Despite this, Martinez says he remains positive that ""people power"" can overcome big money.
""I think the power of people is being recognised as an unstoppable force, both with the mobilisation of bodies on the streets, the mobilisation in our courts, the way that we are taking to the polls,"" he said.
Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva has spent her career taking on multinationals as part of her fight to preserve the planet. Originally trained as a physicist, Shiva has written over 20 books and served as an adviser to NGOs and the Indian government.
She says climate change is the result of irresponsible actors, particularly the fossil fuel industry.
""So, I would say the problem is chemical industrial fossil fuel-based farming, and the solution is ecological biodiverse farming, in the hands of small farmers,"" Shiva said.
""I think we have to reduce the infrastructure that was built for the fossil fuel empire. We've got to learn how to have better lives with a lower ecological footprint,"" she added.
Shiva also says there needs to be a global conservation goal.
""We [do] need a Green New Deal with the earth, remembering that the earth is alive, and we have to work with her laws and processes to protect her species diversity, avoid the sixth mass extinction, and avoid climate catastrophe,"" Shiva said.

** Spanish politics undermining climate change fight | News | Al Jazeera **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/spanish-politics-undermining-climate-change-fight-191209213530920.html *

Spain's desertification puts it on the front lines of the fight against climate change.
Madrid, Spain - With higher-than-average increases in temperature, steadily advancing desertification and rising risks of drought and sea flooding, few would disagree that Spain is on the front line of Europe's battle against climate change. 
But while government officials point to the ongoing COP25 conference as a sign of Spain's firm engagement in the battle against global warming, continuing political deadlock means the country's long wait for a law to fight climate change on home turf continues.
In November, Spain held its fourth general election in four years, which was won by the Socialist Party. But the Socialists' repeated failure to secure a parliamentary majority leaves Spain currently dependent on a caretaker government that cannot pass new laws.
This includes legislation on global warming drafted nearly a year ago, which Spain is said to need to ensure it reaches its 2030 targets on carbon emissions, and despite the Spanish parliament recognising - by an overwhelming 311 votes to 24 - that climate change ""was a cross-party priority"".

""A climate change law doesn't just raise public awareness, it also mainstreams the question across all government policy areas,"" Maik Winges, a specialist on adaption to climate change with the environmental NGO Germanwatch, told Al Jazeera.
""That matters because you cannot adapt [to climate change] and leave something else out in the process.""
Germanwatch's own analysis of Climate Change Performance [CCP] by country also suggests Spain's need for urgent action. Spain is currently ranked 35th in the latest available 2019 CCP index from 2019, rated ""low"", and 19 places below the average for the European Union.
How badly does Spain need a climate change law? Delia Gutierrez Rubio, spokeswoman for Spain's state meteorological service, AEMET, says: ""It is necessary for sure.""
Gutierrez Rubio told Al Jazeera it's clear Spain is exceptionally vulnerable to climate change.
""Since the pre-industrial era, the world's average increase in temperature has averaged 1.1 degrees Centigrade (about 1.98 degrees Fahrenheit) - but in Spain, it's 1.6 degrees (2.88F).
""Our summers are an average of five weeks longer, the number of tropical nights [with temperatures above 20 degrees Celcius (68F)] is increasing, and since 50 years ago, Spain's desert areas have increased by 10 percent. And they're getting bigger.""
A Spanish government report recently predicted a possible rise of between 17 and 35 cm (6.7 - 13.7 inches) in sea level along Spain’s lengthy coastline as soon as 2028 - and it's not just humans feeling the effects, as independent investigations on bird migration patterns suggest.
""Europe's entire population of cranes, for example, used to spend the winter in Spain and in the north of Africa, but now they are staying in France or Germany,"" points out Javier Cano, an ornithologist who works with the SEO-Birdlife NGO.
""Then African species like the trumpeter finch, the spotted vulture or the cream-coloured courser are starting to reproduce in Spain. Twenty or 30 years ago, that wouldn’t have happened.""
While government officials say there is EU praise for their proposed climate change law, NGOs and  specialist academics in Spain have concerns over what it can actually achieve.

""It doesn't do enough in areas like agricultural transport, which has a particularly large carbon footprint in Spain,"" Professor Alberto Mataran Ruiz, an environmental scientist at the University of Granada, told Al Jazeera.
""It gives a great deal of importance to photovoltaic solar energy, too, when building these kinds of solar panels can involve a great deal of CO2 production. And they don't go into enough detail on the effects on territory their plans for wind energy could have.
""It's like they have a plan, but they don't have a road map.""
Javier Andaluz is the climate change spokesman at Ecologistas en Accion (Ecologists in Action). 
""Overall, the advances so far have been more symbolic than real,"" he told Al Jazeera, saying the Socialists had an uneven track record on environmental action, which justified his reservations about the proposed law.
Requests made by Al Jazeera for an interview with officials from Spain's Ministry for Ecological Transition were turned down due to a lack of availability. But popular pressure on the government to act shows no sign of disappearing.
A survey in the newspaper El País published on Sunday indicated that 90.5 percent of Spanish people believe ""urgent"" or ""very urgent"" measures were needed to act against climate change.
However - and even while COP25 continues for a second week in their capital - when it comes to legally binding action on home soil, the Spanish will have to wait.

Bushfires are common during the summer in Australia, but firefighters said this year's conditions are catastrophic.
At least eight people have been killed since September, including two firefighters who died on Thursday when their truck was hit by a falling tree.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison cut short his holiday to Hawaii and issued a rare public apology in response to mounting anger.
Australia's not alone in having to deal with ferocious fires this year. There were more than 1,600 recorded in Europe, large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been destroyed, and tens of thousands of hectares of land and hundreds of buildings in California.
And we've seen wildfires in the Arctic, too - more than 100 - a sign of warming conditions in one of the coldest places on Earth.

** Australia's platypus under threat from climate change | Australia ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/australia-platypus-threat-climate-change-200120034327635.html *

The platypus has disappeared from as much as 40 percent of its historical range due to changes wrought by humans.
Prolonged drought and other effects of climate change are pushing the duck-billed platypus, one of Australia's most unique species, towards extinction, scientists warned in a study published Monday.
The furry river-dwelling mammal has already disappeared from as much as 40 percent of its historical range on the east coast of Australia due to drought, land clearing, pollution and the construction of dams, the researchers said.
Scientists from the University of New South Wales' Centre for Ecosystem Science say if the current threats persist, platypus numbers will fall a further 47-66 percent over the next 50 years.
If projections about worsening climate change are taken into account, the numbers of the egg-laying mammal could plummet up to 73 percent by 2070, they wrote.
""These dangers further expose the platypus to even worse local extinctions, with no capacity to repopulate areas,"" said Gilad Bino, lead author of the study.
Experts say as many as one billion animals may have died in the massive bushfires that took hold of Australia's tinder-dry bush in September, tearing through vast swaths of the country's more-populated southeast and destroying crucial animal habitats.
In work published towards the end of last year, Australian scientists found that 100 of Australia's endemic species had gone extinct since Europeans arrived on the continent.
The first extinction likely took place within 10 years of colonisation, they said in their findings which were published in the scientific journal Biological Conservation. At least three extinctions took place in the last decade.
They found that the introduction of predators like foxes and cats, as well as environmentally significant events like drought and fire, had harmed indigenous species, with climate change emerging as a factor more recently.
John Woinarski of the Threatened Species Recovery Hub at Charles Darwin University's Research Institute for the Environment and Livelihoods and the report's lead author, told Al Jazeera the rate of extinction in Australia was the highest of any continent in the world and ""highly likely"" to accelerate.
Recalling a species of skink he had once held in his hands and was now extinct, Woinarski said the loss of any species was devastating.
""To have held an animal or plant that has gone extinct in your lifetime, it affects your soul,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""Extinctions are part of us. They aren't remote entities. They are real things that had life and vitality and that has been extinguished."" 
The platypus is listed as ""near threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the UNSW scientists said the damage caused by years of minimal rainfall and high temperatures had worsened its prospects.
The scientists said there was an ""urgent need"" for a national risk assessment to determine if the platypus should be recognised as ""vulnerable"" and to lay out conservation steps ""to minimise any risk of extinction"".   
The study is the first across all platypus habitat zones to establish a so-called ""metapopulation"" model while also projecting the impacts of climate change on the species going forward.
The survey estimated the total platypus population had fallen by 50 percent since European settlement in 1788.
An earlier study published in November 2018 estimated the population had fallen by 30 percent over that period, to around 200,000.
""Under predicted climate change, the losses forecast were far greater because of increases in extreme drought frequencies and duration, such as the current dry spell,"" Bino said of the latest report.
The platypus, which along with four species of echidna are the only mammals that lay eggs, has a tail like a beaver, otter-like feet and a venomous spur on its hind leg.

Climate change is happening now, and even world leaders meeting for climate talks at this year's COP25 know we are not doing enough to stop it.
In fact, we are going backwards. The United Nations says carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are going up, and the earth is on track to warm by 3.2 degrees Celsius before the century is over. The consequences of that acceleration are already proving disastrous for communities around the world.
This week's episode of Start Here - with Al Jazeera cuts through the science and the politics, to get you what you need to know about what is at stake for the planet.

** How 'Murdochracy' controls the climate debate in Australia ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/murdochracy-controls-climate-debate-australia-200124052356203.html *

Despite public's desire for action on climate change, media giant News Corp continues to give space to deniers.
Canberra, Australia - Australia's worst-ever bushfires have thrust climate change into the political spotlight, but one of the country's most powerful media conglomerates continues to deny the links between extreme weather events and climate change: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
On January 2, following weeks of horrific losses and fatalities, newspapers around the world put Australia's bushfires on their front pages.
But in Australia, The Australian - News Corp's flagship newspaper - dedicated its front page to a photo of a new year's day picnic, and its tabloid Herald Sun relegated the story to page four.
At that point, eight people had died in the bushfires, mass evacuations were underway from Victoria's East Gippsland region, and the New South Wales (NSW) south coast had seen whole villages wiped out.
It is now believed that 28 people have died in the bushfires across three states since September 2019. More than a billion animals have been killed, over 2,000 houses lost, and at least 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres) burnt.

News Corp's newspapers account for 60 percent of Australia's newspaper sales.
The company also owns some of the world's most influential television channels, including Sky News in Australia and the UK and Fox News in the US. Fox News is US President Donald Trump's favoured television station.
Murdoch's papers in Australia are known for their conservatism, and their columnists frequently rage about the threat posed to the country by immigration, Muslims, and increasing recognition of LGBTQ rights.
The Australian's associate editor once said that climate change was ""not the era's burning issue"", and the paper published an article that argued climate change activists were ""global catastrophists"" and part of a ""socialist plot"".
The Australian public is largely in support of taking more action on climate change.
According to the 2019 Climate of the Nation survey, 61 per cent of Australians believe that climate change is caused by humans and 64 per cent think the country should have a national target for net zero emissions by 2050.
""There is already a strong, broad sentiment in Australia about the increasing importance of reducing emissions,"" science communicator Ketan Joshi told Al Jazeera earlier this month.
Even James Murdoch, the younger son of the 88-year-old media mogul, publicly criticised News Corp and Fox Corporation's coverage of climate change this week via a statement with his wife.
James Murdoch is the former CEO of 21st Century Fox and currently sits on the News Corp board of directors.
""[James and Kathryn Murdoch] are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial of the role of climate change among the news outlets in Australia, given obvious evidence to the contrary,"" the spokesperson said.
Journalism academic and media expert Margaret Simons believes it is significant that the younger Murdoch has spoken out.
""It's rare that the Murdoch family criticise each other in public,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""The fact that the came out so strongly is significant and sent a bit of a shockwave through News Corp in Australia.""
Susan Forde, journalism professor at Griffith University in Brisbane, said News Corp has always been ""very conservative on climate change.""
""There are many people out there - and we know this from the 2019 federal election - who are very ill-informed,"" she explained.

""They are reading this content and believing it, and they agree with Murdoch that we should be focusing on creating more jobs.""
Earlier this month, a News Corp finance manager sent an incendiary email as she resigned that was addressed to chairman Michael Miller and copied to all staff.
""I find it unconscionable to continue working for this company, knowing I am contributing to the spread of climate change denial and lies,"" the woman wrote.
She described the news reports that came out of The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and Herald Sun as ""irresponsible"" and ""dangerous"".
The email was reportedly removed from staff inboxes within an hour.
Faced with increasing criticism, The Australian published an editorial on 11 January, denying that it misrepresented the facts on climate change.
""The evidence of global warming since the Industrial Revolution is clear,"" the editorial said, before going on to blame ""progressive elites"" for overlooking ""the hard work of persuasion and coalition-building"" that is needed on climate change.
News Corp did not respond to requests for comment from Al Jazeera.
Forde of Griffith University has conducted research on media coverage of climate change. She said one problem at News Corp is that its media outlets do not take the reality of climate change as their starting point.

""We tend to think that everything is up to editors, but this is clearly not true. The tone set by the owners of media organisations does in fact have a big impact on content,"" she said.
Former News Corp journalists have also gone on the record about climate change coverage.
In 2019, Rick Morton, at the time employed by The Australian, said ""We kind of know what the editorial line is at the paper… It's not always a Murdoch line; it's just that Murdoch hires editors who are very much like him.""
Simons. the journalism academic, predicts that the longer the debate continues, there will be more resignations from News Corp journalists.
""Some of the Australian's best journalists have been leaving [News Corp] in the last 18 months and some have been very vocal about the reasons why,"" she said.
""For any journalist who is early on in their career, they'd have to ask themselves whether they really want to belong to an organisation which is not contributing to a positive fashion to the defining debate of our times.""
""It will become harder for News Corp to get good journalists to work for them, and this will change the culture.""
There have long been concerns about the Murdoch empire's domination of the Australian media, which led to a government inquiry in 2011, after a phone hacking scandal at the Murdoch-owned News of the World in the UK.
The review found that existing self-regulation mechanisms were insufficient to ensure accountability by media outlets, and recommended that a News Media Council be established to set journalistic standards.
""No-one else is publishing work like News Corp,"" Forde explained. ""They argue that it's under the guise of 'we're the only ones who are balancing the reporting'.""
""It's part of their political and ideological narrative that natural disasters like bushfires have always happened, and if they admit they're out of the ordinary, then they're accepting that climate change is real. So they play it down and employ [writers with] quite extreme views.""
With Australia's largest activist group GetUp! launching a new anti-Murdoch campaign, asking advertisers to pull out of News Corp, Forde believes that people are slowly becoming more aware of Murdoch's influence.
""More people are talking about the 'Murdochracy' and the significant impact that he and his organisations are having on debate, as well as the diversity of public debate and the spreading of false information,"" she said.
Change will probably require an economic threat to Murdoch's outlets, however.
""Editorial positions would need to change for their views to change, and the direction needs to come from Rupert or Lachlan Murdoch themselves,"" Forde concluded. ""They would need to see that they're losing readers, advertisers or shareholders as a result of their current views for there to be a shift.""
Simons agrees change will take time. ""There was a reshuffle of editors in late 2019, but there has been no sign of an appetite for cultural change,"" she said.
""If anything, it was a reinforcement of the existing culture.""

** Too dry to thrive: Climate change spurs Mexicans to change crops ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/dry-thrive-climate-change-spurs-mexicans-change-crops-200221164018321.html *

Global warming may hurt Mexico more than many other countries.


At least 9,000 years ago, humans began domesticating corn for the first time near Tehuacan, in the central Mexican state of Puebla, laying the foundation for permanent settlements in the Americas.
But in the past few years, more frequent and longer droughts have forced many farmers in the area to give up corn and other cereals in favour of alternatives requiring less water, such as pistachio nuts and cactuses.
Agricultural experts predict parts of Mexico will feel the effects of climate change more than many countries, not least because its location - between two oceans and straddling the Tropic of Cancer - exposes it to weather volatility.
Sol Ortiz-Garcia, director of the agriculture ministry's climate change group, noted that 75 percent of Mexico's soil is already considered too dry to cultivate crops. In regions such as Tehuacan, temperatures may rise more than the global average.
""We know there are areas where the increase is going to be greater. That will obviously affect rain patterns, and in turn, agriculture and food security,"" Ortiz-Garcia said.
The area under corn cultivation in Tehuacan decreased 18 percent to about 40,000 hectares between 2015 and last year, shows a Reuters news agency calculation using statistics by the agriculture ministry, outstripping a nationwide decline.
In the five years before that, the area planted with corn had been slowly increasing in Tehuacan. Nationally, the area under corn cultivation declined four percent from 2015 to 7.4 million hectares last year.
While factors leading farmers to switch crops are complex, in Tehuacan farmers and local officials describe a fast-changing climate as a leading cause. Mexico's rainy season last year was the driest since 2011, which in turn was one of the driest on record, numbers from the country's national water agency showed.
Climate change is expected to cause substantial declines in yields of corn globally, especially in the tropics, concluded a 2018 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 
There may be exceptions. The corn belt in the US Midwest is so vast that one recent study concluded the expanses of lush fields were actually helping increase rainfall locally and also cut temperatures, thus allowing even more corn to be grown.
Under this model, intensive farming meant more moisture being released into the atmosphere from plants on a scale great enough to create more rainfall. The greater humidity also contributed to summers up to one degree Celsius cooler, concluded the study, by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In Tehuacan, however, conditions are fast changing for the worse. In a field where dried-out plants have been lingering in the dust since the last drought, farmer Porfirio Garcia, holding a stunted cob, was struggling to make sense of it all.
Corn has for thousands of years been a symbol of Mexican pride, a staple of local and national cuisine from tortillas to tamales and the backbone of civilizations that gave rise to modern Mexico. But climate change has jeopardised that.
Garcia, who has 12 children, half of them working with him on the farm, recalls how one hectare in some years yielded as many as four tonnes (8,800lbs) of corn. In the past five years, he said, with luck that hectare yielded 700kg (1,543lbs).
""The corn harvest has shrunk because in the months of June, July, August and September there was no rain,"" said Garcia, 59, who uses ancestral farming techniques to grow corn, beans and pumpkin, an ancient system called a ""milpa"". ""Our lives center on corn, so what do we do without it?""
Eusebio Olmedo, director of rural development, agriculture and livestock in Tehuacan, recalls that it began to get hotter at the turn of the millennium. Having worked in the department for five years, Olmedo said the area used to be characterised by a ""very pleasant, very benevolent"" climate.
Last year was the warmest on record in the state of Puebla - where Tehuacan is located - with thermometers reaching an average maximum temperature of 26.8 Celsius (80 F). In 1985, the first year that state records were available, Puebla registered an average maximum temperature of 24.7 Celsius (76 F).
A 2016 study commissioned by the environment ministry and backed by the United Nations Development Programme concluded that climate change in Mexico will mean less rain, lower yields for basic grains such as corn, beans and wheat, as well as ""unexpected effects on food security"".
""When rain patterns change, agriculture becomes risky,"" Olmedo said.
Mexican corn farmers have suffered major shocks in the past - most notably the arrival of cheap imports from the US under the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s. In the north of Mexico, where large cornfields are irrigated, climate change may initially have little impact, studies show.
But in the south, where the oldest corn strains on Earth are grown using traditional methods without irrigation, the changing rain patterns and temperatures are already being felt. Agricultural consulting group GCMA estimates Mexican corn production will continue to decline in 2020, and that corn imports mainly from the US will reach a record 18 million tonnes.
Mexico is now the world's second-largest corn importer thanks to a reliance on US grain for animal feed. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador calls that ""a contradiction"", and has implemented programmes to boost national production.
Garcia, however, chose to diversify into other crops, planting 300 trees of pistachio, a desert plant that can withstand temperatures between minus 10C (14F) and 40C (104F).
Nearby farmer Natalio De Santiago also abandoned the corn that he, his father and his grandfather used to plant for other crops that require less water. Those include maguey, a raw ingredient for mezcal, a Mexican liquor.
""I stopped sowing [corn] because the weather is changing,"" said De Santiago, 56. ""Now I plant maguey because it needs less water.""
Wearing a cowboy hat to shield his face from the sun, he said he irrigates 400 maguey plants every month with a litre of water each. When he planted corn, he said, his crops needed four months of rain.
Others in the area gave up agriculture altogether and sold land to real estate developers. In an attempt to stop this trend, local authorities developed a bank of native corn seeds that are more resistant to pests and that need less water.
""We have to adapt to climate change, and these are the best varieties to recover food self-sufficiency,"" Olmedo said of the seeds.
Other government measures meant to help farmers adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change include agricultural insurance, alternative crops and campaigns to reduce agricultural burning.
""It's very difficult to reverse the tendency to increase CO2 [carbon dioxide] in the atmosphere,"" said the agricultural ministry's Ortiz-Garcia. ""That's why we're prioritising adaptation.""
""Climate change is here to stay,"" she added.

** A victory over Sweden's colonialism | Climate Change | Al Jazeera **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/victory-sweden-colonialism-200205092318758.html *


A recent court verdict could affect Indigenous rights in Sweden and beyond.
In late January, the Indigenous Saami reindeer-herding community, Girjas, won a significant legal battle against the Swedish state. The Swedish Supreme Court legally recognised the Indigenous community's ancestral claim to the land they live on and awarded Girjas Saami Village in Gallivare the right to manage hunting and fishing in its territories without the Swedish state's approval.
This landmark ruling comes amid a climate emergency which threatens the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. Indigenous governance of lands and biodiversity are key measures that can help address the climate crisis. As such, Girjas' fight to take back the control of their lands should be seen as urgent climate action, too.
Indigenous communities the world over have the necessary traditional knowledge and experience to survive and thrive without hindering the future of the planet. Yet, they bear the brunt of the climate crisis.
The dominant lifestyles and politics of countries that are currently in control of ancestral Saami lands, from Sweden and Norway to Finland and Russia, have long been threatening Saami culture, food security, traditional livelihoods and the wellbeing of the lands we all depend on. But the threat is more serious now than it has ever been before because of the ongoing climate crisis. 
The ancestral lands of the Saami people make up almost half of Sweden's territories. If it was not for the colonial theft of these lands, Sweden could not have become the prosperous and ""progressive"" nation that it prides itself to be today.
Sweden is the product of a mentality which sees it fit to exploit Indigenous lands and people to its benefit. And this mentality is still alive and well today in its state-backed extraction industries that deplete Indigenous lands, policies that force Indigenous communities to migrate and persistent cultural genocide efforts such as the eradication of Saami languages that cause invaluable losses and intergenerational trauma.
Despite the victory, the Girjas' court case against the state made it clear once again that Sweden is not willing to acknowledge and address its colonial history.
Throughout the trial, the state tried to frame the issue at hand as an administrative dispute, rather than what it actually is: A people's righteous fight to take back what was stolen from them.
State attorneys even tried to claim that Girjas' Indigenous identity is ""irrelevant"" to the case. Emphasising the fact that Sweden has not yet ratified the International Labor Organization Convention 169 on the rights of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, they argued that ""Sweden has no international obligation to recognise special rights for the Saami"" and invited the court to assess the case relying solely on the state's own laws, without giving any special consideration to the identity of the Girjas and their connection to the land. 
Julia Rensberg, from the Saami youth association Saminuorra, outlined during the final proceedings of the case last autumn how the state has tried to resolve the dispute through laws and regulations that were unilaterally imposed on the Saami and that fit the state's agenda only. She said it was necessary to ""remember who founded those laws and during what time they were founded"".
Indeed, the state's lawyer opposing Girjas, Hans Forssell, did not shy away from citing outdated and blatantly racist 19th-century documents to legitimise Sweden's non-recognition of Saami rights to land. Asa Larsson Blind, Chairman of the National Union of the Swedish Saami People, responded to the citation saying ""This is quite upsetting. Everybody knows that these texts exist, and the state said that they would no longer support these kinds of statements. I do not understand why they gave weight to them by pressing them into a legal process.""
While the lines of argument used by the Swedish state in its case against Girjas were undoubtedly disturbing, they were not shocking to anyone familiar with the Scandinavian state's established attitudes towards Indigenous rights.
Beyond referring to racist 19th-century documents in court proceedings and refusing to ratify the ILO Convention 169, the Swedish state also uses a problematic discourse of renewable energy to argue that Saami interests must give way to broader environmental and economic concerns. As Stockholm University's Rebecca Lawrence explained in a 2014 research paper, it attempts to make ""legitimate the argument that there is, quite simply, more room for wind power 'up north' than in the more heavily populated and industrialised southern areas of Sweden"", rendering Saami land uses invisible.
The Swedish state's treatment of the Saami has also been under repeated criticism from international organisations like the Office of the High Commissioner of the UN and the Council of Europe.  
Indeed, we can no longer ignore the problem that is at the core of the ongoing fight against climate change. But climate actions, technologies and Green New Deals cannot achieve sustainable change if they ignore the plight of Indigenous communities, serve colonial interests and help sustain the same harmful systems and mechanisms that we have today. 
Countries like Sweden should no longer be allowed to show off their green credentials while actively contributing to the looming climate catastrophe by ignoring the plight of Indigenous communities. 
A delegation of Saami and Inuit activists at the COP25 in Madrid last year tried to draw attention to the importance of ""land back"" movements in the fight against climate change. Julia Rensberg, who was part of the action in Madrid, said:
""The land is us, and we are the land. We are here to stand in solidarity with our Indigenous relatives and we call on you to have our backs! We must come together to break the toxic culture of Green Colonialism that is taking a hold of the environmental movement."" 
Girjas' victory against the Swedish state should be seen as proof that despite all obstacles, Indigenous communities have the power and resolve to take big and powerful actors to task who stand in the way of sustainable climate action. While it is not clear what this victory would mean for Saami beyond Girjas, the court's decision provides new hope to find communal ways to survive and thrive on this planet. 
Indigenous activists from Sapmi in Europe, to the Amazon, and the Wet'suwet'en territory in lands claimed by Canada, are holding the frontline of ecological and social breakdown for all of us. Through resistance and community organising they are working tirelessly on multiple fronts to dismantle social constructs that feed into Indigenous invisibility, anti-blackness, hetero-patriarchy, and white supremacy. This is the kind of resistance that is key to averting the climate crisis. 
Non-Indigenous people must become allies and follow the lead of radical Indigenous visionaries like Girjas. Only then, will there be a real chance for just, democratic and sustainable futures for all of us.

** Amazon's Bezos pledges $10bn to fight climate change | News | Al ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/amazon-bezos-pledges-10bn-fight-climate-change-200217212616788.html *

World's richest man is on the growing list of billionaires giving substantial money to fight global warming.




Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will commit $10bn to fund scientists, activists, nonprofits and other groups fighting to protect the environment and counter the effects of climate change, he said on Monday.
Bezos, who is the world's richest man, is among a growing list of billionaires who have pledged to dedicate substantial funds towards combating the impact of global warming.
""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,"" Bezos said in an Instagram post. ""I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share.""
The Bezos Earth Fund will begin issuing grants in mid-2020 as part of the initiative.
""It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation-states, global organizations, and individuals,"" Bezos said.
Counteracting climate change has become a popular cause for United States billionaires in recent years, with Microsoft founder Bill Gates, financial-data company founder Mike Bloomberg, and hedge fund manager Tom Steyer counted among the world's wealthiest environmental philanthropists. ⁣⁣⁣
Last year, Bezos pledged to make online retailer Amazon net carbon neutral by 2040 - the first major corporation to announce such a goal - and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from US vehicle design and manufacturing startup Rivian Automotive LLC.
Bezos also said at the time that Amazon would meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord ten years ahead of the accord's schedule and invest $100m to restore forests and wetlands.
Cutting emissions related to Amazon, which delivers 10 billion items a year and has a massive transportation and data centre footprint, will be challenging.
The company has faced recent protests by environmental activists in France and rising pressure from its employees to take action on climate change.

** Coronavirus is curbing carbon emissions | News | Al Jazeera **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/coronavirus-curbing-carbon-emissions-200310205000051.html *

COVID-19 is slowing economies and emissions, and experts say greener criteria could help avert future outbreaks. 




With the rapid spread of the coronavirus beyond China, the president of the United States is hoping that spring temperatures will halt the contagion in its tracks the same way that common cold strains abate by summer.
""You know, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away, that's true,"" US President Donald Trump said last month.
The mercury is once again rising faster, with January 2020 posting the highest temperatures on record for the first month of the year.
But health experts are loath to assume that the number of new cases will fall as the northern hemisphere emerges from a mild winter.
""No one knows for sure what warmer temperatures will mean for COVID-19 because it is a novel virus, but WHO [World Health Organization] has said that there is no evidence currently that we should expect this outbreak to subside with warming temperatures,"" Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health programme at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera.
While global warming may not make the coronavirus go away, the outbreak is temporarily curbing carbon emissions. And financial experts say new sustainability criteria for assessing investment risks could help governments and the private sector initiate measures that could avoid future outbreaks.  
'Falls in economic activity'
More than 4,000 people have died of COVID-19, with 113 confirmed cases across 109 countries and territories, according to WHO. 
Regardless of how climate change might impact the dissemination of the coronavirus droplets, the disease is temporarily reducing carbon emissions in China and elsewhere as many factories remain shuttered and fuel consumption goes down.
""The most immediate impact of coronavirus is falls in economic activity, which will reduce greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions,"" Faith Ward, chief responsible investment officer at Brunel Pension Partnership, told Al Jazeera.
And as the spread of COVID-19 slows in China, some experts have called attention to major environmental improvements around Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began.
""There do seem to be good data supporting the conclusion that emissions of GHGs and conventional air pollutants have gone down in China,"" said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.
He told Al Jazeera that the airline industry is the best current example of such a decline in emissions.
During a three-week span in China, daily flights went down from over 15,000 to barely 2,000, according to tracking firm Flightradar24.
With Italy and other nations likely to copy aspects of China's lockdown model, demand for air travel, oil and electricity could keep declining.
Automobile use, manufacturing and industrial production have clearly dipped, causing fewer emissions. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant that is released when fossil fuels are burned, have decreased some 40 percent in China - according to Washington Post analysis of data from the Sentinel-5P satellite.
But if history is any guide, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions may not last. The 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, oil shocks of the 1970s, and the 2008 financial crisis caused ephemeral drops in polluting activities - before the economy fell back into high-emissions mode.  
Some business sustainability experts believe that as the public and private sectors become more cognizant of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, this prism could provide a framework for more effectively meeting the challenges of climate change and viral epidemics.
""Both coronavirus and climate change reinforce the need for investors to manage ESG issues or face rapidly escalating and global financial risks,"" said Maria Lettini, executive director of the FAIRR Initiative, a collaborative investor network that represents $20 trillion in assets under management.
""Mainstream investors such as BlackRock are now taking climate risk seriously and urging companies to do the same through processes like scenario analysis and setting science-based targets,"" she told Al Jazeera.
FAIRR - which raises awareness about sustainable food investment - is particularly focused on how the coronavirus itself is believed to have emerged from a live-animal market in Wuhan.
""We need urgent engagement on diseases originating in animals destined for the food system, whether it's coronavirus, African swine fever, or avian flu, or the many other animal pandemics in recent years,"" Lettini added.
She said coronavirus highlights ""critical safety issues"" and raised ""a serious red flag"".
With the next United Nations climate conference in Glasgow eight months away, it is too soon to tell whether governments will be still be too consumed by the fight against coronavirus to make meaningful progress in the battle to stem global heating.
But with quarantines and lockdowns set to multiply exponentially, the connection between human and ecological well-being is becoming ever clearer.
""Regulation may need to evolve to better safeguard public health and environmental outcomes,"" said Lettini.

** Big ecosystems could collapse faster if tipping point reached | News ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/big-ecosystems-collapse-faster-tipping-point-reached-200311085410870.html *

Breakdown of Amazon rainforest could happen within 50 years if ecological point-of-no return is crossed, study says.
Large ecosystems the size of the Amazon rainforest could collapse within decades once a tipping point has been passed, scientists have warned, predicting a much faster breakdown than previously assumed.
Research published on Tuesday in the scientific journal Nature Communications concluded that big biomes the size of Caribbean coral reefs could die off in only 15 years if they reach their own point-of-no-return, while those the size of the Amazon rainforest could degrade within 50 years.
In both examples, the projected threshold for irreversible change stems from the effect of global warming and environmental damage - deforestation in the case of the Amazon, and pollution and acidification for corals.
The United Nations climate science advisory panel, the IPCC, has said that 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) of atmospheric warming above preindustrial levels would doom 90 percent of the world's shallow-water corals, while a 2C (3.6F) rise would spell their near-complete demise. Earth's surface has already heated up more than 1C (1.8F).
Meanwhile, the change in pH level - the measure of how acidic the sea actually is - reduces the ability of marine organisms to form shells and corals to grow branches, affecting their life, growth and reproduction.
In the case of the Amazon, the temperature tipping point is less clear - but scientists estimate that clearing 35 percent of its surface would trigger its eventual demise.
About 20 percent of the Amazon basin rainforest - straddling seven nations and covering more than five million square kilometres (two million square miles) - has been wiped out since 1970, mostly for the production of lumber, soy, palm oil, biofuels and beef.
""We must prepare for regime shifts in any natural system to occur over the 'human' timescales of years and decades, rather than multigenerational timescales of centuries and millennia,"" the study of more than 40 different kinds of ecosystems read.
Lead author Simon Willcock, a professor at Bangor University's School of Natural Science, meanwhile noted that recent out-of-control fires in the Amazon and Australia - both made more likely and more intense by climate change - suggest that many ecosystems are ""teetering on the edge of this precipice"".
Scientists have long warned about the deteriorating status of ecosystems due to increasing temperatures and ecological damage, but larger ecosystems were believed to be more resilient due to their size.
However, the authors of the new research found that the rate at which these systems can disintegrate and then disappear is significantly faster than in smaller ones. The reason is that their sub-systems and habitats can initially seem more resilient, but then unravel very rapidly when a tipping point is reached.
""The messages here are stark. We need to prepare for changes in our planet's ecosystems that are faster than we previously envisaged,"" said John Dearing, professor in physical geography at the University of Southampton and lead author of the report.
Overall, the study examined 42 ecosystems - four terrestrial, 13 freshwater and 25 marine - of various sizes.
However, alack of data collected from the observation of tropical rainforests made some scientists question whether the report's findings can be applied on the Amazon. 
""It is very unlikely, if not dystopian, to expect that an area half the size of Europe will experience a complete shift in vegetation in just 50 years,"" Erika Berenguer, a senior research associate at the University of Oxford and Lancaster University, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.
""While there is no doubt that the Amazon is at great risk and that a tipping point is likely, such inflated claims do not help either science or policymaking,"" she said.

** Coronavirus lockdown leads to improved air quality | News | Al ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus-lockdown-leads-improved-air-quality-200322094404592.html *

Economic slowdown as a result of COVID-19 is no substitute for climate action, experts stress.
Efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus pandemic have slashed economic activity and resulted in localised improvements in air quality, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has said.
However, it is too early to assess the implications for concentrations of greenhouse gases that are responsible for long-term climate change. That is because carbon dioxide levels at key observing stations have so far this year been higher than the previous one.
In its statement on Friday, the WMO stressed that any cuts in emissions as a result of the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic are not a substitute for concerted climate action.
""Despite local reductions in pollution and improvement in air quality, it would be irresponsible to downplay the enormous global health challenges and loss of life as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.
""However, now is the time to consider how to use economic stimulus packages to support a long-term switch to more environmentally and climate-friendly business and personal practices"".
Taalas added that ""past experience suggests that emissions declines during economic crises are followed by a rapid upsurge. We need to change that trajectory.
""The world needs to demonstrate the same unity and commitment to climate action and cutting greenhouse gas emissions as to containing the Coronavirus pandemic. Failure in climate change mitigation could lead to greater human life and economic losses during the coming decades,
According to an analysis carried out for Carbon Brief, the lockdown and reduction in economic activity in China led to an estimated 25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the space of four weeks.
The February monthly average of atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii was 414.11 parts per million, compared to 411.75 ppm in February 2019, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Mauna Loa is the world's longest continual observing station and a benchmark station of the Global Atmosphere Watch Network. At another benchmark station, Cape Grim in Tasmania, average CO2 levels were 408.3 ppm in February, up from 405.66 ppm in February 2019, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.
About a quarter of the total emissions is absorbed by the oceans. Another quarter is absorbed by the land biosphere - including forests and vegetation which act as carbon ""sinks"".
Naturally, the land biosphere takes up a similar amount of CO2 than it releases over the year in a seasonal cycle. Therefore, global average CO2 levels generally increase until April/May.
Observations have shown that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels are significantly reduced during the lockdown in both hard-hit China and Italy.
In Italy, a gradual reduction trend of about 10 percent a week over the past four to five weeks has been confirmed by surface observations from the European Union's Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service.

** The coronavirus outbreak is part of the climate change crisis ... **

* https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/coronavirus-outbreak-part-climate-change-emergency-200325135058077.html *


Therefore, climate action should be central to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.


The speed and scope of the coronavirus outbreak have taken world governments by surprise and left the stock market reeling. Since the virus first appeared in China's Hubei province, it has infected over 700,000 people and killed more than 33,000 across the world in less than six months.
The interconnectedness of our globalised world facilitated the spread of COVID-19. The disruption this continues to cause has made evident societal dependence on global production systems.
The pandemic has forced governments into a difficult balancing act between ensuring public safety and wellbeing and maintaining profit margins and growth targets. Ultimately, the prospect of a large death toll and the collapse of health systems have forced countries to put millions of people on lockdown.
These sweeping and unprecedented measures taken by the government and international institutions could not but make some of us wonder about another global emergency that needs urgent action - climate change. 
The two emergencies are in fact quite similar. Both have their roots in the world's current economic model - that of the pursuit of infinite growth at the expense of the environment on which our survival depends - and both are deadly and disruptive. 
In fact, one may argue that the pandemic is part of climate change and therefore, our response to it should not be limited to containing the spread of the virus. What we thought was ""normal"" before the pandemic was already a crisis and so returning to it cannot be an option.
Despite the persistent climate denialism in some policy circles, by now it is clear to the majority across the world that climate change is happening as a result of human activity - namely industrial production.
In order to continue producing - and being able to declare that their economy is growing - humans are harvesting the natural resources of the planet - water, fossil fuels, timber, land, ore, etc - and plugging them into an industrial cycle which puts out various consumables (cars, clothes, furniture, phones, processed food etc) and a lot of waste.
This process depletes the natural ability of the environment to balance itself and disrupts ecological cycles (for example deforestation leads to lower CO2 absorption by forests), while at the same time, it adds a large amount of waste (for example CO2 from burned fossil fuels). This, in turn, is leading to changes in the climate of our planet.
This same process is also responsible for COVID-19 and other outbreaks. The need for more natural resources has forced humans to encroach on various natural habitats and expose themselves to yet unknown pathogens.
At the same time, the growth of mass production of food has created large-scale farms, where massive numbers of livestock and poultry packed into megabarns. As socialist biologist Rob Wallace argues in his book Big Farms Make Big Flu, this has created the perfect environment for the mutation and emergence of new diseases such as hepatitis E, Nipah virus, Q fever, and others.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three out of four new infectious diseases come from human-animal contact. The outbreaks of Ebola and other coronaviruses such as MERS, for instance, were triggered by a jump from animal to human in disturbed natural habitats.
In the case of COVID-19, it is suspected that the virus was transmitted to humans at a ""wet market"" in the city of Wuhan, where wildlife was being sold.
The mass-scale breeding of wild animals, including pangolins, civet cats, foxes, wild geese, and boar among many others is a $74bn industry in China and has been viewed as a get-rich-quick scheme by its rural population.
The origin of the virus makes it a perfect example of how the way capitalism commodifies life to turn it into profit can directly endanger human life. In this sense, the ongoing pandemic is the product of unrestrained capitalist production and consumption patterns and is very much part of the deleterious environmental changes it is causing.
The failure to contain it is also due to the capitalist drive of the global economy. In the United States, some have claimed that profit losses from the freezing of economic activity are not worth closing the country for business for more than 15 days. 
The World Bank Group has also recently stated that structural adjustment reforms will need to be implemented to recover from COVID-19, including requirements for loans being tied to doing away with ""excessive regulations, subsidies, licensing regimes, trade protection...to foster markets, choice, and faster growth prospects."" 
Doubling down on neoliberal policies which encourage the unrestrained abuse of resources would be a catastrophic prospect in a post-COVID-19 world. The suspension of environmental laws and regulations in the US is already a frightening sign of what returning to ""normal"" means for the establishment. 
Although both COVID-19 and climate change are rooted in the same abusive economic behaviour and both have proven to be deadly for humans, governments have seen them as separate and unconnected phenomena and have therefore responded rather differently to them.
The vast majority of countries around the world - albeit with varying degrees of delay - have taken strict measures to curb the movement and gathering of people in order to contain the virus, even at the expense of economic growth.
The same has not happened with climate change. Current climate change measures have taken little heed of the scale and progression of the environmental changes we are experiencing. Climate change does not follow four-year election cycles or five-year economic plans. It does not wait for 2030 or 2050 Sustainable Development targets.
Various aspects of climate change progress at different speeds and in different locations and although for some of us these changes might not be obvious or palpable, they are happening. There are also certain thresholds which if crossed will cause change to be irreversible - whether in greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, the loss of insect populations or the melting of the permafrost. 
And while we do not get daily updates on the death toll caused by climate change, as we do with COVID-19, it is much deadlier than the virus.
Global warming of 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels could easily lead to a series of catastrophic outcomes. It could severely affect our ability to produce food by decreasing the fertility of soils, intensifying droughts, causing coastal inundations, increasing the loss of pollinators, etc. It could also cause severe heatwaves across the world, which have already proven increasingly deadly both in terms of high temperatures and the wildfires they cause, as well as more extreme weather phenomena like hurricanes. 
Pursuing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, carbon offsetting schemes, incremental eco-efficiencies, vegan diets for the wealthy and other similar tactics will not stop climate change because they do not discourage mass industrial production and consumption but simply shift their emphasis. Such approaches will never work because they do not entail the necessary radical change of our high-powered lives that is required to force us to slow down and reduce our emissions.
The rapid response to COVID-19 around the world illustrates the remarkable capacity of society to put the emergency brake on ""business-as-usual"" simply by acting in the moment. It shows that we can take radical action if we want to. 
Lockdowns across the world have already resulted in a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants. In China, for instance, the lockdown caused carbon dioxide to drop by at least 25 percent and nitrogen dioxide by 37 percent. 
Yet, this temporary decrease in greenhouse gases should not be a cause for celebration. The fact is that as a result of the lockdowns, millions of people have already lost their jobs and billions will probably struggle amid the economic downturn the outbreak is causing. 
While some have called for climate change to be just as drastic as the one undertaken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it should not be. We need a just climate transition which ensures the protection of the poor and most vulnerable and which is integrated into our pandemic response. This would not only reverse the climate disaster we are already living in but also minimise the risk of new pandemics like the current one breaking out. 
The just climate transition should involve economic reforms to introduce ""planned degrowth"" that puts the wellbeing of people over profit margins. The first step towards that is ensuring the stimulus packages that governments are announcing across the world are not wasted on bailing out corporations. 
We must avoid at all costs a situation where unscrupulous big businesses and state actors are allowed free reign to reinforce appalling global inequality while the rest of civil society is quarantined at home. 
We should demand that government funds are instead allocated to decentralised renewable energy production in order to start implementing the Green New Deal and create new meaningful jobs amid the post-COVID-19 economic crisis. In parallel, we should ensure the provision of universal healthcare and free education, the extension of social protection for all vulnerable populations and the prioritisation of affordable housing.
The current response to COVID-19 could help usher in some of these changes. It could get us accustomed to lifestyles and work patterns that minimise consumption. It could encourage us to commute and travel less, reduce household waste, have shorter work weeks, and rely more on local supply chains - i.e. actions that do not hurt the livelihoods of the working classes but shift economic activity from a globalised to a more localised pattern.
Obviously, the conditions surrounding COVID-19 are not ideal, but the rapid and urgent actions in response to the virus and the inspiring examples of mutual aid also illustrate that society is more than capable of acting collectively in the face of grave danger to the whole of humanity.

** The harm from worrying about climate change - BBC Future **

* https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191010-how-to-beat-anxiety-about-climate-change-and-eco-awareness *


Menu
Back in 2014, my partner and I marked a date in our shared online calendar. Unusually, this was for 27 August 2015 – a year ahead. It was an arbitrary date.
We’re indecisive when it comes to big life decisions, and this was the biggest: whether to have children. We were aware that, now in our 30s, we couldn’t wait indefinitely to decide. So we marked “baby-making conversation” in the calendar, as ever using irreverence in an attempt to make weighty matters seem less daunting, and happily pushed the question away for the time being.
But 27 August 2015 came and went. We felt no more prepared. We moved the date back another year. Then 27 August 2016 passed too. Clearly our stratagem hadn’t worked. While plenty of factors affected our ambivalence, the personality-level issues were overshadowed by a global one: anxiety about a future planet made unliveable by climate change.
Climate change harms mental wellbeing in a number of ways. From trauma and stress following disasters, to relationship damage caused by separation and displacement, the psychological effects of climate change can be enduring. Of course, these effects are heightened for certain vulnerable populations, such as elderly and low-income people, as well as those on the frontlines of climate change.
But even people whose lives and livelihoods don’t depend directly on the climate can feel the psychological strain. As noted in a report by psychology professor Susan Clayton at the College of Wooster and colleagues, “the ability to process information and make decisions without being disabled by extreme emotional responses is threatened by climate change”.

Researchers at the University of Bath have some suggestions. When I visit the university, surrounded by woodland, with soaring views of the stately city below, Caroline Hickman and I decide to talk not in her office, but by a small lake on campus. We sit on rocks surrounded by sunbathing students and preening ducks, and swap stories of climate anxiety (or Hickman’s preferred term, “eco-awareness”). We have plenty to talk about, as it’s the day after the hottest temperatures ever recorded in the UK. Hickman, a psychotherapist and researcher who studies children’s attitudes towards climate change in the UK, the Maldives and other countries, is frustrated by the flippant media treatment of the previous day. As ever, I’m nervous about this latest harbinger of doom.
Yet Hickman insists that climate anxiety – like climate depression or climate rage – isn’t a pathology. It’s a reasonable and healthy response to an existential threat. “I’d kind of wonder why somebody wasn’t feeling anxious,” she says. (Read about why 'flight shame' is causing people to change how they travel.)
So the first step is to acknowledge the validity of these feelings. The job of a climate psychologist is then to ask: “How can we support you to make this part of your life and not all of your life?” Hickman might encourage patients to join an activist group, or a discussion and support groups like a climate cafe.
In one study of a programme called Carbon Conversations, which involves group discussion and activity to reduce climate impacts, half of participants said that the programme helped them face their worries about climate change. And greater emotional engagement was associated with more change in habits. This showed the linked benefits of feeling part of a community, reckoning with difficult feelings, and taking constructive measures.
This kind of research has been put into practice at New York University’s Environmental Health Clinic, which prescribes climate-friendly actions and group activities to its visitors. “There’s less space for anxiety emotionally when you take practical steps,” Hickman notes.
This is true even for extreme feelings. Hickman has counselled parents who fantasise about killing their children, out of fear of the climate-ravaged future. But she calmly points out that history is rife with examples of parents preparing to end their children’s lives in order to protect them. “If we disallow those feelings, we’re just driving them back into the unconscious,” Hickman argues.
The parents who confess these dark thoughts to her aren’t actually going to act on them, she believes, and it’s important for them to have a safe, shame-free mental space to express the depth of their anxiety. Psychotherapy and other psychology tools can help people become more comfortable with the uncertainty that is inevitable when it comes to climate change.
“One of the routes through the anxiety is to engage with your grief and your sense of loss,” Hickman says.

A world away, in the north Indian village of North Salmara, Gautam Barman happens to be putting into practice much of what the climate psychology research suggests about forging community connections and practical actions. When journalist and businessman Abhideep Choudhury and I visit Barman and his colleagues from the Maharanee Tea Company, we sit among lush tea gardens and a factory busily drying and processing leaves.
“Now it is not healthy, our garden,” Barman laments. The ideal temperature for their tea is 30-33C, he says. But they’re now seeing 37-38C. The Maharanee growers attribute the higher temperatures to deforestation, as villagers are forced by poverty into cutting down shade-providing trees, as well as to global warming. The higher temperatures directly affect the growers’ income: scorching the plants, producing fewer usable green leaves, and requiring more breaks for the workers who pluck the leaves by hand.
The stakes are high. Residents in the area decided to invest in its tea-growing potential decades ago, when the state of Assam was being torn apart by intermittent ethnic conflict. They envisioned that tea planting would provide a livelihood option for young Assamese who would otherwise feel compelled to join the militant groups. The growers organised themselves into four self-help groups, who sought training and pooled money to buy trucks. Maharanee now employs more than 700 people, so the climate’s influence on tea production affects many households locally.
But Barman is briskly optimistic. The growers are planning to go organic, which will command higher prices. They have also been planting trees for shade on their small plots in an effort to beat the heat.
This will have environmental and financial benefits, but this kind of climate action is helping the growers’ wellbeing as well. “I feel better here than in my own house,” says Jagadish Chandra Ray, standing proudly amidst his two hectares of tea plants. It’s clear that nature-based activities help mental health, and that a local and collective focus helps people to grapple with the larger climate crisis, but Ray doesn’t need reports to tell him that.
Having emerged out of self-help groups, and banded together to open a factory, the Maharanee growers’ concrete responses to climate change effects are inspiring

I, on the other hand, am part of the problem. Round-trip flights between London and Guwahati, the closest airport to North Salmara, emit over three tonnes of carbon dioxide – about twice as much as the average Indian emits in a whole year. I've come to India for other reasons besides visiting these tea gardens, though all my work and carbon offsets can’t entirely offset environmental guilt.
“When we’re scared, we can freeze,” points out Susan M Koger, a psychology professor at Willamette University in Oregon, who teaches and writes about psychology for sustainability. “We can become paralysed by fear, or just tune out. We use various kinds of defence mechanisms to distract, to deflect, to numb out.” This kind of “psychic numbing” is unhelpful, both in dealing with the climate crisis and more generally. Also unhelpful is the guilt that I’m prone to. Koger says, “Guilt is not a useful emotion because guilt is not motivating. But instead of guilt, we can reframe it as responsibility.”
Back in Bath, I grope around for ways to reframe my negative emotions, with the help of Hickman. “The primary support that people get is through their doctors and medication and CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy], none of which is particularly appropriate in response to the climate emergency,” she says. Hickman’s approach is a little different. She insists that the psychology she practices is mainstream, yet some of the things she says are out of sync with certain establishment psychologists, and she’s unafraid to be controversial.
“I can see you’re struggling with it,” she says. She smilingly implies that I’m being defensive and shying away a little, and perhaps I am. Midway through our conversation, I swap out my eyeglasses for sunglasses – mostly because of the glaring sun, but partly because I’m feeling the need to shield myself in other ways. I’ve made only passing references to my partner and children, so I’m startled when Hickman perceptively brings this up later on. But my parenthood status, like the state of the world, remains unresolved.
I’m not alone in this larger discomfort. The work of Hickman, a member of the Climate Psychology Alliance, is influenced by the idea of “deep adaptation”. The concept is controversial among some climate scientists and psychologists for positing that societal collapse is inevitable. (This has driven some readers of an infamous, and influential, deep adaptation paper to move to the countryside and to visit therapists like Hickman.)

“On a personal level, I think that’s probably true. It’s definitely hard to remain hopeful,” acknowledges Koger. “However, I do think that’s dangerous. I think it’s personally dangerous and I think it’s societally dangerous because if there’s no hope, then there’s no reason to take action.” Koger wants to avoid the self-fulfilling prophecy of climate doomism (which some have argued is just as harmful as climate change denial). “For me personally, I need to feel that I’m making some kind of a difference.”
Hickman, who is also a scuba-diving instructor, adapts scuba principles to both couples counselling and climate therapy: Stop. Breathe. Think. Connect. Act. “What we need in response to the climate emergency is both internal and external solutions,” she says, and this scuba-like model allows for both self-care and the collective action needed to confront climate breakdown. One of the takeaways is that just presenting facts about climate change isn’t as helpful as encouraging people to reflect on that information, including any discomfort they might feel.

At the end of our conversation, we watch dragonflies flitting around the lake and bulrushes swaying in the light breeze. We squeal at fuzzy ducklings following in their mother’s wake, in a perfect V formation.
I’ve spent two hours talking about climate change, which would normally have me feeling apprehensive and queasy. But for a moment, focused on the ducklings, the heaviness in my chest is gone.

Millions more people will be at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea-level rise later this century.
That's the conclusion of new research conducted by Climate Central, a US-based non-profit news organisation.
It finds that 190 million people will be living in areas that are projected to be below high-tide lines come 2100.
Today, the group calculates roughly 110 million are presently occupying these lands, protected by walls, levees, and other coastal defences.
The future at-risk total assumes only moderate global warming and therefore limited ocean encroachment.
Climate Central's investigations, published in the journal Nature Communications, have sought to correct the biases in the elevation datasets previously used to work out how far inland coastlines will be inundated.
The most famous of these datasets comes from a space shuttle mission. 
The Endeavour orbiter used a radar instrument in 2000 to map heights across the globe. This 3D model of the planet has become one of the most used Earth observation datasets in history.
But the Climate Central team, of Scott Kulp and Benjamin Strauss, says it suffers from biases that in places make the land look higher than it really is.
This problem occurs particularly in locations where there is thick vegetation, such as forests; the radar tends to see the tree canopy, not the ground.
Kulp and Strauss used more modern, higher-resolution information from airborne lidar (laser) instruments to train a computer to make corrections to the shuttle's digital elevation model (DEM).
When this new CoastalDEM is used in tandem with population statistics and the latest forecasts for sea level rise, it becomes apparent that many more people are entering a precarious future.
The improved elevation data finds that even with moderate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, six Asian countries (China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand), where 237 million people live today, could face annual coastal flooding threats by 2050. That's roughly 183 million more than assessments based on prevailing elevation data.
New estimate versus old estimate
The team has produced an interactive map that illustrates the difference between estimates based solely on the shuttle legacy data and the reworked elevations.
And it's possible to see on this map how circumstances change depending on how well the world manages to constrain climate warming, which is pushing up ocean levels by heating the seas and melting ice stored in Antarctica and Greenland.
Under a pessimistic future of continued high emissions, CoastalDEM suggests up to 630 million people live today on land that is projected to have annual flood events by 2100. 
For 2050, this number is 340 million, up from the estimated 250 million people who already live in this predicament.
In general, the CoastalDEM-derived estimates of the global population at risk from coastal flooding are three times greater than the values produced using just the shuttle information.
""We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10m above current high tide lines, including 250 million below 1m,"" the team tells Nature Communications.
Sea levels have been rising globally by over 3mm per year in recent decades, with an acceleration in this trend now observable.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated last month in a special report on the oceans that global average sea levels could rise by up to 1.1m by 2100, in the worst warming scenario.  
Kulp and Strauss stress some limitations in their analysis.
For example, it assumes a static population - future growth and migration are not considered. Nor are improvements in coastal defences.
On a regional basis, the Climate Central analysis will be less surprising where coastal lidar surveys are already used to assess future flood risk. But its value is significant for those places which don't enjoy such good coverage. 
And in a number of locations, the future risks are only partly to do with sea-level rise. Some of the world's coastal megacities have the additional challenge of subsidence.
In places, the ground is going down 10 times faster than the water is coming up.
This has been true of places like Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and Bangkok where too much groundwater has been extracted from underlying soils.
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

Mountaineering in some parts of the world is becoming riskier because of climate change, climbing experts and scientists warn.
They say warming in the Alps has thinned ice and snow cover, resulting into frequent rock-falls and landslides.
Their concerns were voiced at a meeting of the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation this week.
Melting glaciers have also added challenges for mountaineers.
Climbing routes have either had to be abandoned or changed because of the increased risks.
In some places, climbing seasons have had to be brought forward.
A study of mountaineering plans for climbers in the Mont Blanc massif showed numerous changes. Almost all climbing ""itineraries"" for the region had been affected since the 1970s and a few routes no longer existed.
In the journal Arctic, Antarctic and Alpine Research, Jacques Mourey from the University of Grenoble Alpes and colleagues wrote: ""Moreover, periods during which these itineraries can be climbed in good conditions in summer have tended to become less predictable and periods of optimal conditions have shifted toward spring and fall, because the itineraries have become more dangerous and technically more challenging.""
A 2017 study of several summits in the Mont Blanc massif by a French team showed significant degradation of permafrost between 1850 and 2015.
This led to the slopes becoming unstable, causing rockfalls.
Findings from a study in the Austrian Alps have been similar.
""Many of these routes have become extremely dangerous,"" Florian Ritter, from the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences in Vienna, and colleagues wrote recently in the journal BioOne Complete.
""Numerous classical ice climbs in the Eastern Alps have become heavily affected by rockfall and falling stones, as well due to rocks melting out at the ice margins... during late summer and autumn.""
The Austrian research also pointed to other factors. 
""While the described processes related to global warming might increase the potential, events are generally triggered by other processes that are less linked to global warming, such as extreme rain events,"" it said.
Analysis of guidebooks written for those climbing in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, confirms the changes.
""In the climbing guides, multiple generations of climbers noted the climbing dangers for whole mountain ranges,"" said co-author Arnaud Tremme, a geographer with Wageningen University in the Netherlands.
""The oldest guide out of the dozens of guides used in the research was written 146 years ago, this allowed us to record the changes for a longer period and link these with climate change.""
For the past 10 years, a network of wireless sensors on Mount Matterhorn in the Alps has been streaming data on the condition of steep rock faces, permafrost and prevailing climate.
""Based on the data we have received, we see that the rate of change is quite fast,"" said Jan Beutel, a Zurich-based researcher, who leads the monitoring project.
""As a result, some of the places can't be visited anymore.""
A study on Aoraki Mount Cook in New Zealand also highlighted difficulties for climbers.
Climbers here have to navigate the Tasman Glacier, but this is now becoming more difficult because it's melting.
""One of the interesting results of our study was the spatial variability associated with climate change - the impacts are greater at lower elevations, but much higher on the mountains. Because of the large seasonal snowfall, the effects are somewhat buffered,"" Heather Purdie, one of the authors of a study on the mountain told the BBC.
Mountain guides say routes are now becoming more challenging and they have had to adapt.
""Rockfalls are becoming the biggest challenge,"" says Christian Trommsdorff, president of the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations.
""Although impacts of the changing climate differ; on some mountains they are massive, while on others they are not.""
Professional mountaineers in the US say some peaks in the Pacific Northwest that still have glaciated terrain have become increasingly hazardous. In some cases, it is no longer possible for mountaineers to climb them.
""The combination of crevasses becoming un-crossable, overhead icefall hazard increasing and rockfall events occurring regularly has made many classic routes more dangerous and less predictable,"" said Angela Hawse, president of the American Mountain Guides Association.   
Although few studies along these lines have been conducted in the Himalayas, mountain guides in the region say climbing is becoming riskier.
They say wearing crampons on thin ice and exposed rocks is particularly dangerous.
""It becomes like wearing (ladies') high heels on a marble surface,"" says Tshering Pande Bhote, vice president with the Nepal Mountain Guides Association.
""When there is enough snow and ice, the crampons get their grip but now that is becoming less and less available.""
Nepalese mountain guides say that widening crevasses are also becoming a threat.
""We have noticed that the gaping of crevasses, mainly underneath the surface, are increasing and it appears that is happening because of accelerated melting,"" said Mr Bhote.
A number of studies in the Himalayas, mainly in the Everest region, have shown that glaciers there are fast retreating.
The Khumbu glacier, that Everest climbers must cross before their ascent, has seen several ponds forming on it and joining up because of its rapid melt.
The annual meeting of the International Federation of Climbing and Mountaineering in Cyprus will also be discussing how to operate in the changing circumstances.
Mr Trommsdorff agreed that the changing nature of different routes needed to be included in training mountain guides.
""We are starting to do something in this regard but we need more of research and development support,"" he said.
""But we also adapt very well to such changes.""
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

** Climate change: Polarstern icebreaker begins year-long Arctic drift ... **

German Research Vessel Polarstern has found a location to begin its year-long drift in Arctic sea-ice.
The ship, which will head the North Pole's biggest scientific expedition, will settle next to a thick ice floe on the Siberian side of the ocean basin.
The precise location is 85 degrees north and 137 degrees east.
Hundreds of investigators will use it as a base from which to probe the impacts of climate change at the top of the world.
""After a brief but intensive search, we've found our home for the months to come,"" said expedition leader Prof Markus Rex, from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI).
""It may not be the perfect floe but it's the best one in this part of the Arctic and offers better working conditions than we could have expected after a warm Arctic summer.""
RV Polarstern set out on its MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) mission two weeks ago.
It travelled from the Norwegian port of Tromsø, supported by other icebreakers in search of a suitable piece of ice where it could set up a camp.
Sixteen possible locations were scouted with the aid of satellite imagery and helicopters. A metres-thick floe measuring roughly 2.5km by 3.5km was eventually chosen.
The international expedition considers itself lucky to have identified its home so soon after departing Tromsø. This summer's warmth has produced the second smallest Arctic sea-ice extent in the satellite era. As a consequence, the ice capping the ocean surface is very thin.
The floes, though, are now succumbing to the winter freeze-up. The Sun no longer rises above the horizon at the ship's location and it won't be long before the 24-hour darkness of ""polar night"" descends on the MOSAiC expedition. 
RV Polarstern will soon be locked solid in the ice. 
The vessel won't break free again until September or October next year, by which time it will have drifted past the North Pole and be in waters somewhere in the Fram Strait. This is the passage that runs between northeast Greenland and the Svalbard archipelago.
MOSAiC's objective is to study all aspects of the climate system in the Arctic. Instrument stations will be set up on the ice all around the ship, including some up to 50km away.
The ice, the ocean, the atmosphere, even the wildlife will all be sampled. The year-long investigations are designed to give more certainty to the projections of future change.
Prof Rex told the BBC before departure that the Arctic was currently warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet but that the climate models were highly uncertain as to how this temperature trend would develop in the coming decades.  
""We don't have any robust climate predictions for the Arctic and the reason is we don't understand the processes there very well,"" he explained.
""That's because we were never able to observe them year-round, and certainly not in winter when the ice is at its thickest and we can't break it with our research vessels."" 
Something similar to the €130m (£120m/$150m) MOSAiC mission has been tried before, but nothing comparable in scale.
About 600 scientists are expected to spend months at a time with the Polarstern.
They'll be brought in by the support icebreakers.
When that's not possible at the height of winter, when the sea-ice is at its thickest, aircraft and long-range helicopters will have to deliver the necessary supplies and relief teams.
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

Peatlands are a natural carbon sink, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere and burying it in the soil.
In Europe alone, they lock up about five times more carbon than forests.
But according to a new study, the continent's peatlands are in such a dry and fragile state, they could go into reverse, releasing rather than absorbing carbon.
Scientists say it is more important than ever that we restore and safeguard these boggy landscapes.
Researchers examined 31 peatlands across England, Ireland, Scandinavia and continental Europe to assess changes during the last 2,000 years.
The study, published in Nature Geoscience, found that most peatlands had become drier during the period 1800-2000 than they had been for the last 600 years.
Dr Maarten Blaauw from Queen's University Belfast said peatlands ""have been a great help to our planet"" - they suck carbon out of the atmosphere and store it, which helps to mitigate climate change.
This study, however, shows that ""the drying of our bogs appears to have changed this process and the peatlands could now actually be turning into carbon sources - instead of absorbing carbon actually starting to emit it - clearly this is not good news for our planet"".
Dr Graeme Swindles from the University of Leeds, who led the study, said it is more important than ever that we safeguard peatlands with effective management and active restoration.
""The combined pressure of climate change and human impacts may push these vitally important carbon storing ecosystems into becoming a global source of carbon emissions."" 
Peatlands are a type of wetland found in almost every country on Earth, from blanket bogs in the UK to swamp forests in Southeast Asia. 
The term ""peatlands"" refers to the peat soil and the wetland habitat around it.
Peat forms over the course of millions of years as waterlogged conditions slow the process of plant decomposition.
Natural peatlands across the world store more carbon dioxide (CO2) than all other vegetation types in the world combined.
Large amounts of carbon, extracted from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, represent a global carbon store.
Countries are encouraged to include peatland restoration in their commitments to global international agreements on climate change, as this can help reduce emissions.
Climate change, peat extraction, drainage, burning and conversion to farmland have all exacted a toll on peatlands.
About 15% of the world's peatlands - covering less than 0.4% of the global land surface - have been drained, releasing greenhouse gases into the air, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN.

The biggest and most damaging hurricanes are now three times more frequent than they were 100 years ago, say researchers.
Using a new method of calculating the destruction, the scientists say the increase in frequency is ""unequivocal"".
Previous attempts to isolate the impact of climate change on hurricanes have often came up with conflicting results.
But the new study says the increase in damage caused by these big cyclones is linked by global warming.
Hurricanes or tropical cyclones are one of the most destructive natural disasters. The damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was estimated to be $125bn, roughly 1% of US GDP.
One of the big questions that scientists have wrestled with is how to compare storm events from different eras. Is the increase in financial damages recorded over the last century simply down to the fact there are now more people living in the paths of hurricanes, who are generally wealthier?
Previous research has concluded that the rise in damages was related to wealth, and not to any statistically significant change in frequency.
However this new paper challenges that view. 
Instead of looking at economic damage, the authors looked at the amount of land that was totally destroyed by more than 240 storms between 1900 and 2018, based on insurance industry databases. 
As an example, the researchers examined Hurricane Irma that hit Florida in 2017. 
Around 1.1 million people were living inside the 10,000 sq km closest to the storm's landfall. 
With the wealth per capita estimated to be $194,000, the scientists concluded that the overall wealth in this 10,000 sq km region was $215bn. 
As the storm caused $50bn worth of damage, this was 23% of the wealth in the region. Taking 23% of the 10,000 sq km gave an area of total destruction of 2,300 sq km. 
By working out similar figures for events across the last century, the researchers were able to make what they say are more realistic comparisons in terms of damage over the decades. 
The authors found that the frequency of the most damaging hurricanes had increased by a rate of 330% per century.
And they believe that is mainly due to rising temperatures.
""Our data reveal an emergent positive trend in damage which we attribute to a detectable change in extreme storms due to global warming,"" they write.  
The scientists involved believe their new method is solid and gives a more accurate picture of what is happening with the worst storms.
""The new method of looking at the frequencies is really robust,"" said Aslak Grinsted, from the University of Copenhagen, who carried out the study.
""The increase in frequency is not only in my own dataset but is also present in other datasets, so it is extremely robust, and I think that will help it become more accepted."" 
The study has been published in the journal PNAS.

** How climate change could kill the red apple - BBC Future **

* https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191119-how-climate-change-could-kill-the-red-apple *


Menu
The archetypal apple is – no two ways about it – red. There may be yellow apples or green apples in the grocery store too. In some places, you might even find varieties that are striped or mottled with a profusion of hues, like the gorgeous Cox’s Orange Pippin.
But red – or occasionally, pure, sharp Granny Smith green – is the colour of apples in most alphabet books. It’s an interesting detail, because apples were not always so resolutely monochrome.
The ancestors of the modern apple were wild trees growing in what is now Kazakhstan, on the western slope of the mountains which  border western China. Today, wild apple trees still grow there, perfuming the air with fallen fruit and feeding the bears that lumber through the forest, although the wild apples’ numbers have shrunk by 90% in the last 50 years thanks to human development and their future is uncertain.
You might also like:
The fruits range from pale yellow to cherry red and spring green, but red is not generally more prominent than the other colours. (One apple-loving traveller, Beck Lowe, reports that ironically a commercial Kazakh orchard, like orchards everywhere around the world, is growing Red Delicious and Golden Delicious, apples of American origin.)
Apple colour arises from the expression level of certain genes in the skin, scientists have found. David Chagne, a geneticist at Plant and Food Research in New Zealand, explains that sets of enzymes work together to turn certain molecules into pigments called anthocyanins, the same class of substances that give purple sweet potatoes, grapes and plums their colour.
The levels of these enzymes are controlled by a transcription factor – a protein that regulates how much a gene is expressed – called MYB10, such that the more MYB10 there is, the redder the skin will generally be. In fact, one study found that in apples with red stripes, MYB10 levels were higher in the striped portions of the skin.
As temperatures rise, chemical changes within the apple make a red skin less likely (Credit: Getty Images)
Intriguingly, colour also depends on temperature. To get an apple that’s fully red, temperatures must stay cool, Chagne says, because if they climb to above about 40C (104F), MYB10 and anthocyanin levels crash. In the Pyrenees region of Spain, he and his colleagues found normally vividly red striped apples were completely pale after a particularly hot July. As temperatures warm, he suggests, it could become more difficult for apples to turn red.
He and colleagues are nonetheless looking to breed red-as-red-can-be fruits for the Asian market, where a deep ruby is a popular colour, using their understanding of the biology behind colour.
Perhaps the threat that climate change poses to the red apple will be counterbalanced by our sheer determination to breed them, even if it takes expensive breeding programmes. Even before we understood the genetics, colourful apples exerted a strong pull on humans. John Bunker, an apple collector based in Palermo, Maine, has rescued numerous forgotten breeds from extinction. These include apples that used to be grown a century or more ago before orcharding became so Delicious-focused, including the magnificent Black Oxford, an apple whose red is so dark you might mistake it for an enormous plum before seeing its brilliant white flesh. “The colours are phenomenal. And I think that for some people including myself that was the original attraction,” he says.
Colour probably didn’t trump other features of an apple when growers were evaluating a new tree, however. Instead, they focused on the taste and use for the apple: some are good for cider, some for pies, some for sauce, and some for eating. It didn’t much matter exactly what the fruit looked like and whether it looked the same from tree to tree, because farmers were growing fruit for themselves and for their local market, and function mattered more than looks.
Bunker says that all changed about a hundred years ago. “In a culture of small diversified farms and small diversified farm economies, uniformity is of limited value,” he says. But if apples grown for thousands of miles around are [to] be bought as interchangeable, the colour becomes a kind of branding. It says “this is what to expect”. In this commodity system, uniformity was growing more valuable. At the same time, apples began to be picked before they were truly ripe so they could be shipped long distances without rotting.
There was a problem, however. “Colour is a ripeness indicator,” Bunker points out. Apples picked early didn’t have the right colour. But then an apple with a mutation that gave it a rich red tone before it was ripe came to the fore, he explains. That apple was eventually dubbed the Red Delicious, and in 1921 was released commercially for orchardists.

Other apples rose in the ranks as well – varieties that were discovered to have a regular, uniform colour, especially if it came before the apple had actually reached full ripeness, were good for business.
The number of varieties farmers grew started to shrink. And little by little, some of these varieties stopped tasting so good, as the emphasis on appearance didn’t encourage growing for flavour. David Bedford, an apple breeder at University of Minnesota, says that he grew up eating Red Delicious and consequently not being very fond of apples: it took him trying another variety in college to awaken him to the possibility that apples could be different, he reflects, “not skin like Naugahyde and texture like Elmer’s glue”.
He and his colleagues are behind the wildly successful Honeycrisp apple, released some years ago and known for its juicy crispness. And in fact, the Honeycrisp they released was a yellow-and-red-striped beauty.
But even in apples bred to get away from the curse of the Red Delicious, the inexorable drive for red continues. People have now introduced Honeycrisps with mutations that make them more and more red. “It happens to every single apple on the market,” says Bedford. “That’s just the nature of our desire to have apples the way we want to them to look… ever since man has been making choices they’ve been making them redder and redder.”
The redder apples might not be better than the yellower ones – in fact they might be worse – but, he explains that “red sells, that’s the problem”. To attempt to correct for this in future apples, the University of Minnesota has released other apples under what’s called a club model. In this system, growers aren’t allowed to select for redder fruit.
When you see the wild variety of colours that is possible, and recognise the danger of an ever-redder drift disconnected from true flavour, it can make you hope for better days to come for apple eaters. Will the apple’s true, weird nature ever triumph over the hunt for red? History suggests it will be an uphill battle, but we can all dream.

** Venice floods: Climate change behind highest tide in 50 years, says ... **

Severe flooding in Venice that has left much of the Italian city under water is a direct result of climate change, the mayor says. 
The highest water levels in the region in more than 50 years would leave ""a permanent mark"", Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted.
""Now the government must listen,"" he added. ""These are the effects of climate change... the costs will be high.""
The waters in Venice peaked at 1.87m (6ft), according to the tide monitoring centre. Only once since official records began in 1923 has the tide been higher, reaching 1.94m in 1966. 
Images showed popular sites left completely flooded and people wading through the streets as Venice was hit by a storm. 
St Mark's Square - one of the lowest parts of the city - was one of the worst hit areas. 
St Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years, according to church records. Pierpaolo Campostrini, a member of St Mark's council, said four of those floods had now occurred within the past 20 years. 
The mayor said the famous landmark had suffered ""grave damage"". The crypt was completely flooded and there are fears of structural damage to the basilica's columns.
The city of Venice is made up of more than 100 islands inside a lagoon off the north-east coast of Italy.
Two people died on the island of Pellestrina, a thin strip of land that separates the lagoon from the Adriatic Sea. A man was electrocuted as he tried to start a pump in his home, and a second person was found dead elsewhere.
Mr Brugnaro said the damage was ""huge"" and that he would declare a state of disaster, warning that a project to help prevent the Venetian lagoon suffering devastating floods ""must be finished soon"". 
""The situation is dramatic. We ask the government to help us,"" he said on Twitter, adding that schools would remain closed until the water level subsides. 
He also urged local businesses to share photos and video footage of the devastation, which he said would be useful when requesting financial help from the government. 
People throughout the city waded through the flood waters. 
A number of businesses were affected. Chairs and tables were seen floating outside cafes and restaurants. 
In shops, workers tried to move their stock away from the water to prevent any further damage. 
One shopkeeper, who was not named, told Italy's public broadcaster Rai: ""The city is on its knees.""
Three waterbuses sank, but tourists continued their sightseeing as best they could. 
One French couple told AFP news agency that they had ""effectively swum"" after some of the wooden platforms placed around the city in areas prone to flooding overturned. 
On Wednesday morning, a number of boats were seen stranded. 
A project to protect the city from flooding has been under way since 2003 but has been hit by soaring costs, scandals and delays. 
The so-called Mose project - a series of large barriers or floodgates that would be raised from the seabed to shut off the lagoon in the event of rising sea levels and winter storms - was successfully tested for the first time in 2013.
The project has already cost billions of euros in investment. According to Italy's infrastructure ministry, the flood barriers will be handed over to the Venice city council at the end of 2021 following the ""final phase"" of testing. 
Italy was hit by heavy rainfall on Tuesday with further bad weather forecast in the coming days. Venice suffers flooding on a yearly basis.
By BBC meteorologist Nikki Berry
The recent flooding in Venice was caused by a combination of high spring tides and a meteorological storm surge driven by strong sirocco winds blowing north-eastwards across the Adriatic Sea. When these two events coincide, we get what is known as Acqua Alta (high water).
This latest Acqua Alta occurrence in Venice is the second highest tide in recorded history. However, if we look at the top 10 tides, five have occurred in the past 20 years and the most recent was only last year. 
While we should try to avoid attributing a single event to climate change, the increased frequency of these exceptional tides is obviously a big concern. In our changing climate, sea levels are rising and a city such as Venice, which is also sinking, is particularly susceptible to such changes. 
The weather patterns that have caused the Adriatic storm surge have been driven by a strong meridional (waving) jet stream across the northern hemisphere and this has fed a conveyor belt of low pressure systems into the central Mediterranean. 
One of the possible effects of a changing climate is that the jet stream will be more frequently meridional and blocked weather patterns such as these will also become more frequent. If this happens, there is a greater likelihood that these events will combine with astronomical spring tides and hence increase the chance of flooding in Venice. 
Furthermore, the meridional jet stream can be linked back to stronger typhoons in the north-west Pacific resulting in more frequent cold outbreaks in North America and an unsettled Mediterranean is another one of the downstream effects.

Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases once again reached new highs in 2018.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says the increase in CO2 was just above the average rise recorded over the last decade. 
Levels of other warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, have also surged by above average amounts.  
Since 1990 there's been an increase of 43% in the warming effect on the climate of long lived greenhouse gases. 
The WMO report looks at concentrations of warming gases in the atmosphere rather than just emissions. 
The difference between the two is that emissions refer to the amount of gases that go up into the atmosphere from the use of fossil fuels, such as burning coal for electricity and from deforestation. 
Concentrations are what's left in the air after a complex series of interactions between the atmosphere, the oceans, the forests and the land. About a quarter of all carbon emissions are absorbed by the seas, and a similar amount by land and trees. 
Using data from monitoring stations in the Arctic and all over the world, researchers say that in 2018 concentrations of CO2 reached 407.8 parts per million (ppm), up from 405.5ppm a year previously.  
This increase was above the average for the last 10 years and is 147% of the ""pre-industrial"" level in 1750. 
The WMO also records concentrations of other warming gases, including methane and nitrous oxide. About 40% of the methane emitted into the air comes from natural sources, such as wetlands, with 60% from human activities, including cattle farming, rice cultivation and landfill dumps. 
Methane is now at 259% of the pre-industrial level and the increase seen over the past year was higher than both the previous annual rate and the average over the past 10 years. 
Nitrous oxide is emitted from natural and human sources, including from the oceans and from fertiliser-use in farming. According to the WMO, it is now at 123% of the levels that existed in 1750. 
Last year's increase in concentrations of the gas, which can also harm the ozone layer, was bigger than the previous 12 months and higher than the average of the past decade.
What concerns scientists is the overall warming impact of all these increasing concentrations. Known as total radiative forcing, this effect has increased by 43% since 1990, and is not showing any indication of stopping.
""There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline, in greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere despite all the commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.   
""We need to translate the commitments into action and increase the level of ambition for the sake of the future welfare of mankind,"" he added.
""It is worth recalling that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago. Back then, the temperature was 2-3C warmer, sea level was 10-20m higher than now,"" said Mr Taalas.
The UN Environment Programme will report shortly on the gap between what actions countries are taking to cut carbon and what needs to be done to keep under the temperature targets agreed in the Paris climate pact. 
Preliminary findings from this study, published during the UN Secretary General's special climate summit last September, indicated that emissions continued to rise during 2018.
Both reports will help inform delegates from almost 200 countries who will meet in Madrid next week for COP25, the annual round of international climate talks.

A global group of around 11,000 scientists have endorsed research that says the world is facing a climate emergency.
The study, based on 40 years of data on a range of measures, says governments are failing to address the crisis.
Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing ""untold human suffering"" the study says.
The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat.
Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world. 
So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a ""suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years"".
These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption.
Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018.
Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency.
""An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date,"" said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney.
""That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people."" 
The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor. 
Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference. 
These are:
Energy: Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables. 
Short-lived pollutants: These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades.
Nature: Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2.
Food: A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical.
Economy: Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence.
Population: The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day.
Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the research 
The authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research. 
All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online. 
""We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a  a problem,"" said Dr Newsome.
The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action.  However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope. 
""We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change.
""As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress.""
The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option. 
""It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth,"" said Dr Newsome. 
""It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level.""

As the climate warms, birds are shrinking and their wingspans are growing, according to a new study.
Researchers analysed 70,716 specimens from 52 North American migratory bird species collected over 40 years.
The birds had died after colliding with buildings in Chicago, Illinois.
The authors say the study is the largest of its kind and that the findings are important to understanding how animals will adapt to climate change.
""We found almost all of the species were getting smaller,"" said lead author Brian Weeks, an assistant professor at the school for environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan.
""The species were pretty diverse, but responding in a similar way,"" he said. ""The consistency was shocking.""
He said studies of animal responses to climate change often focus on shifts in geographical range or timing of life events, like migration and birth. But this study suggests body morphology is a crucial third aspect.
""That's one major implication,"" he said. ""It's hard to understand how species will adapt without taking all three of these things into consideration.""
The findings showed that from 1978 to 2016, the length of the birds' lower leg bone - a common measure of body size - shortened by 2.4%. Over the same time, the wings lengthened by 1.3%.
The evidence suggests warming temperatures caused the decrease in body size, which in turn caused the increase in wing length.
""Migration is an incredibly taxing thing they do,"" Mr Weeks said, explaining that the smaller body size means less energy available for the birds to complete their long journeys.
He says the birds most likely to survive migration were the ones with longer wingspans that compensated for their smaller bodies.
The scientists aren't exactly sure why warmer temperatures cause birds to shrink. One theory is that smaller animals are better at cooling off, losing body heat more quickly due to their larger surface-area-to-volume ratios.
Mr Weeks said the body of specimens was the result of a ""herculean effort"" by Dave Willard, co-author of the study and an ornithologist at the Field Museum in Chicago.
In 1978, he started walking around buildings in the mornings during spring and fall migration to collect birds that had collided with buildings.
Birds usually migrate at night and are attracted to the artificial light from buildings, causing fatal collisions with windows. Hundreds of millions of birds are estimated to be killed in building collisions each year.
""He didn't have this study in mind,"" Mr Weeks said. ""He just thought it could be useful in the future.""
Over the years, many volunteers and scientists contributed to the collection efforts.
Mr Willard measured all 70,716 specimens himself using the same methods, ""the gold standard"" for this type of data, according to Mr Weeks.
The paper was published in the journal Ecology Letters.
It builds on a growing body of evidence that suggests animals are shrinking as the climate warms.
In 2014, researchers found that alpine goats appeared to be shrinking due to warming temperatures. The same year, another study found salamanders had shrunk rapidly in response to climate change.
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

The Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended his government's stand on climate change as the country deals with devastating fires and a historic heatwave.
Mr Morrison said his policies on reducing emissions would ensure what he called a ""vibrant and viable economy, as well as a vibrant and sustainable environment.""
Australia is one of the world's biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters, and there's been a long-running debate about the country's approach to climate change.
So what is it doing to reduce emissions?
Under the Paris Climate Agreement to tackle rising global temperatures, Australia set a target for 2030 of making a 26-28% reduction in its emissions compared with 2005 levels.
These goals have been criticised for being too low, and last year the United Nations (UN) reported that Australia was not on track.
The UN found that: ""There has been no improvement in Australia's climate policy since 2017 and emission levels for 2030 are projected to be well above the target.""  
About half of the G20 countries (those with the biggest economies), including Australia, are falling short. 
The Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last out of 57 countries responsible for more than 90% of greenhouse gas emissions on climate policy. 
It highlighted the country's no-show at a UN climate summit in September and its withdrawal from an international fund to tackle climate change.
The opposition Labor Party in Australia has said the government is ""refusing to act"" on climate change.
However, the Australian government maintains it is on course to meet its 2030 commitments. ""Our climate policy settings are to meet and beat the emissions reduction targets,"" according to Australian PM Scott Morrison.
Australian emissions will be only 16% lower than 2005 levels in 2030, according to projections published in December.
But it says it will meet the 2030 targets by counting the quantities of carbon already reduced under the previous international climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol.  
(In million tonnes, 2018)
More important than specific targets - Australia as a fossil fuel producer has so far failed to acknowledge the need to plan for a world of net zero emissions, says Myles Allen, a climate change expert at the University of Oxford. 
Net zero means balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal.
Australia is among the world's largest exporters of iron ore, uranium, coal and natural gas.
It was the fourth largest producer of coal in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency.
Phasing out coal is considered crucial to limiting global warming to within 1.5C, but the Australian government is continuing to back the industry for the role it plays in the economy.
Facing criticism over his handling of the bushfires and response to climate change, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said he will not make ""reckless"" cuts to the coal industry.
The government recently approved the construction of a controversial new coal mine - which could be the biggest in the world and would export coal to India. 
A central climate plan is the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF). 
The government put forward an additional A$2bn (£1bn) spread over 15 years to help businesses and farmers reduce emissions, bringing up total investment to $4.5bn. The government says it will deliver 100 million tonnes of emissions reductions. 
Though aspects of the ERF have been praised, ""Australia has adopted a piecemeal approach to emission reduction,"" said the OECD (an economic body which monitors richer, industrialised nations) in a 2019 report. 
The government needs to show how existing instruments, such as the ERF, can be scaled up to reach Paris Agreement goals, added the report.
Scientists round the world are looking aghast at the politics of climate change in Australia.
It's one of the most vulnerable countries on the planet to rising temperatures, yet there is still denial about the impacts of rising CO2 levels on events like the current wildfires.
There is no serious doubt among scientific institutions that rising global temperatures are leading to record heat.
The heatwaves are driven by a natural phenomenon but they are adding to an already over-heated planet.
In the election, the victorious Liberal (conservative) Party categorised climate change as a metropolitan fad for urban professionals, and gained support for the world's biggest coal mine. 
Coal is the dirtiest fuel and scientists say we shouldn't be building more coal-fired power stations if we want to stabilise the climate.

The longest United Nations climate talks on record have finally ended in Madrid with a compromise deal.
Exhausted delegates reached agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon.
All countries will need to put new climate pledges on the table by the time of the next major conference in Glasgow next year. 
Divisions over other questions - including carbon markets - were delayed until the next gathering. 
After two extra days and nights of negotiations, delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the Glasgow conference next year.
All parties will need to address the gap between what the science says is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, and the current state of play which would see the world go past this threshold in the 2030s. 
Supported by the European Union and small island states, the push for higher ambition was opposed by a range of countries including the US, Brazil, India and China.
However a compromise was agreed with the richer nations having to show that they have kept their promises on climate change in the years before 2020.
Next year's big climate conference will be held in Glasgow, Scotland - and that heaps enormous pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
He's already been warned by environmentalists that he will be ""humiliated"" if he tries to lead other nations whilst the UK is still failing to meet its own medium-term climate targets.
The UK's climate advisers warn that tens of millions of homes must be insulated.
Other experts say Mr Johnson's £28.8bn road-building plans are not compatible with eliminating CO2 emissions.
They say even fully electric cars won't solve the problem completely - and urge the government to help people walk and cycle to benefit their health and the environment.
They also say expanding aviation will increase emissions.
Mr Johnson's Brexit decisions will play a part too. The US won't discuss climate change in any trade deal. Meanwhile the EU is putting a border tax on countries that don't cut greenhouse gases. It will be impossible to please both. 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was disappointed by the result.
""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said, quoted by AFP.
'Another year of failure'
Meanwhile, Laurence Tubiana from the European Climate Foundation, and an architect of the Paris agreement, described the result as ""really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed.""  
""Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations, but thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters.""
Decisions on other issues including the thorny question of carbon markets have been delayed until Glasgow.

This aspect of the deal was welcomed by campaigners.
""Thankfully the weak rules on a market based mechanism, promoted by Brazil and Australia, that would have undermined efforts to reduce emissions has been shelved and the fight on that can continue next year at COP26 in Glasgow,"" said Mohamed Adow, with the group Power Shift Africa.
Many of those in attendance were unhappy with the overall package, feeling it did not reflect the urgency of the science. 
Spain's acting Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the mandate was clear.
""Countries have to present more ambitious NDCs [nationally determined contributions] in 2020 than what we have today because it is important to address science and the demands of people, as well as commit ourselves to do more and faster."" 
However, negotiators will be satisfied to have kept the process alive after these difficult and complex talks in Madrid.
The world is now nearly one degree Celsius warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
The 20 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past 22 years, with the years from 2015-2018 making up the top four.
The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise by 3-5C by the end of this century.
A threshold of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policy makers have argued that keeping temperature rise to within 1.5C is a safer limit for the world.
But an IPCC report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"".
There are varying degrees of uncertainty about the scale of potential impacts. 
But the changes could drive freshwater shortages, bring sweeping changes to our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. 
Even if we cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically now, scientists say the effects will continue because parts of the climate system, particularly large bodies of water and ice, can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. 
It also takes greenhouse gases decades to be removed from the atmosphere.

At the conclusion of UN climate talks in Madrid, our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers the key lessons.
COP25 in Madrid only happened because the Chilean government, faced with mounting civil disorder, decided to cancel the meeting in Santiago.
Spain stepped in and in three weeks organised a well-resourced and well-run event. 
However, the fact that it was being run by one government, while hosted by another, gave rise to severe difficulties. 
Delegates were highly critical of the fact that when it came to the key text about ambition, the Chileans presented the lowest common denominator language first, resulting in a huge number of objections from countries eager to see more ambition on carbon cuts. 
Experienced COP watchers said they should have started with high ambition and negotiated down to a compromise.
Insiders say that agreement was only found because of the influence of Spanish minister Teresa Ribera who played a key role in bringing parties together during the long, last night of negotiations.
This was the word that was most widely used to describe COP25. 
There was a yawning gap between the demands of those outside the process and the actions of those within.
This disconnect was the difference between the urgency underlined by the latest science, the demands for more ambitious climate targets from school strikers around the world, and the torturous, convoluted nature of the talks. 
During the talks, young activists staged an unauthorised protest that saw hundreds ejected by security. 
""It's clear that civil society is at a boiling point, they are frustrated with the glacial pace and they are livid with the presence of polluters and their trade associations,"" said Sriram Madhusoodanan from Corporate Accountability, a campaign group that monitors the presence of the oil and gas industry at COP.
""If these talks are ever going to deliver, governments have to take a long serious look at why its failed for 25 years, and start by kicking polluters out.""
This will be the most critical climate encounter in 2020. 
The next conference of the parties may be in Glasgow, but the chance of any real success there will be determined, to a large extent by what happens in the EU-China summit taking place in the German city of Leipzig next September. 
The hope is that by then the EU will have formalised its zero-carbon long term goal and also updated its 2030 pledge to cut emissions by 55% of 1990 levels. 
The EU will likely try and secure agreement from the Chinese to improve their nationally determined contribution (NDC).
Back in 2014 the climate pact signed by President Obama and President Xi Jinping became the lynchpin of the Paris Agreement.

Many observers hope that if the EU and China can do the same, it will be a massive boost for Glasgow. 
""The good news is that the Chinese president is coming to the summit,"" said Li Shuo, a senior policy adviser with Greenpeace China.
""From the Chinese perspective the NDC enhancement decision is one that has to be made at the very top level so the fact the president is going would provide one potential condition for a political level decision.""
At Paris in 2015, countries submitted their first climate plans, which was relatively easy for many of the larger developing countries. 
But in 2020, they are supposed to do much more and as Madrid proved, many are fighting this hard. 
The actions of the US in pulling out of Paris and adopting an antagonistic attitude to the COP have chimed with the desire among some of the larger emitters to put off difficult decisions. 
That was clearly evident in Madrid. 
So Australia fought hard to keep old carbon credits in the system because it wants to use them to reduce its own carbon rather than taking actions that might impact consumers. 
India became much more vocal about the need for an examination of whether richer countries have done enough in the years running up to 2020. 
If countries can't be persuaded to move away from these self-protective positions, Glasgow will suffer the same fate as the ill-fated Copenhagen COP in 2009.
The key takeaway from Madrid is that making progress in climate talks requires huge preparation, strong diplomacy and very committed leadership.
Because Madrid failed to clarify so many key issues the onus now falls on the UK to resolve many of the most challenging questions. 
In Glasgow, the question of loss and damage, of carbon markets, transparency and many other technical issues will need to solved. 
Most importantly the countries will have to agree a major boost in their carbon cutting if the world is to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century.
At a time when the UK will be negotiating trade deals with the EU and with the US, it is going to require enormous diplomatic clout to deal with the climate question as well.
""The diplomacy to build the confidence of the Chinas and the Indias that they can do more and they will be supported, through economic co-operation and that everyone else is moving in that direction, is incredibly important for changing the politics heading into next year,"" said Jennifer Tollman, a climate expert with the E3G think tank.
""The UK can't do it on its own. They will have to outsource this to people they know and trust.""

We know the warnings by now. 
2019 is on course to be in the top three warmest years on record.
The UK government has declared a national climate emergency.
And now, UN Secretary General António Guterres says the ""point of no return is no longer over the horizon"".
That came ahead of the UN's two-week gathering of countries to discuss climate change and set targets - the 25th Conference of the Parties (COP25).
So what really gets done at these conferences - and do they actually work?
Many countries have individual targets related to climate change.
For example, the UK government has committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions right down to net-zero by 2050.
But there are also worldwide targets for countries which take part in the UN climate change summits.
The Montreal Protocol, adopted in 1987, was an international agreement to try to heal the ozone layer, which protects Earth from ultraviolet rays but was being destroyed by man-made chemicals.
By last year it was found to be successfully healing - the Northern Hemisphere could be fully fixed by the 2030s and Antarctica by the 2060s, according to a UN report.
The COP meetings - which focus on greenhouse gases - started in 1995. But it was 1997 when the first significant targets were set.
The Kyoto Protocol, agreed in Japan in 1997, set targets for 37 countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
The targets were different for each country, depending on how developed they were.
But the US pulled out in 2001 - because they were unhappy that developed countries had legally binding targets, while less developed nations didn't have binding targets.
Canada pulled out in 2011 and a lot of other countries missed their targets.
In 2012, the Kyoto Protocol was updated in Doha, Qatar.
But the deal only covered Europe and Australia, whose share of world greenhouse gas emissions was less than 15%.
However, it paved the way for the Paris Agreement in 2015 - also known as COP21 - which was another significant step in climate change talks.
The Paris Agreement went further than any other international climate change deal.
It was agreed by 195 countries in 2015 and came into force in November 2016.
Some of the main pledges were:
One of the main differences to the Paris deal was that it allowed countries to submit their own targets - rather than tell countries what their targets were.
This got the US and Canada back on board.
But since then, the US has started to withdraw from the agreement, as President Trump says it's unfair on the US economy.
He has said he wants to make it easier for fossil fuel producers in the US.
But there's an election in the US in November 2020, and a different president could cancel the withdrawal.
Although the Paris Agreement was generally well-received, the UN itself has said it doesn't go far enough.
A report from the UN Environment Programme in 2017 says the Paris Agreement only covers a third of the emission reductions needed.
It says that the world is still on course to warm by more than 2C.
The report recommends putting more ambitious targets in place in 2020.
Next year's targets are what's expected to be discussed at this year's COP25 in Madrid.
The 2020 summit will be held in Glasgow and countries have committed to submit new and updated national climate action plans.
The UN Secretary General António Guterres will tell the meeting that the world is now facing a full-blown climate emergency.
He said before the conference: ""In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.""
It could be seen as an acknowledgement that while the climate change summits can be a step towards a better future, more needs to be done - and time is running out.

Scientists say global warming could have a catastrophic effect on the planet.
Human activities have increased carbon-dioxide emissions, driving up temperatures. Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. 
The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  
There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. 
This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. 
Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. 
This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.
Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. 
This is known as climate change or global warming.
The greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.
Carbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.
Most man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. 
Since the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.
Other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.
The world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.
The 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.
Across the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  
Most of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.
However, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.
And satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. 
Satellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  
The effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.
The change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.
The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.
Temperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer.
An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"".
The UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.
But even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. 
There is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. 
It could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.
As the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.
Poorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. 
Plant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.
As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.
Global warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts. 
Responding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.

A tiny spark in the UK’s hydrogen revolution has been lit – at a university campus near Stoke-on-Trent.
Hydrogen fuel is a relatively green alternative to alternatives that produce greenhouse gases.
The natural gas supply at Keele University is being blended with 20% hydrogen in a trial that's of national significance.
Adding the hydrogen will reduce the amount of CO2 that’s being produced through heating and cooking.
Critics fear hydrogen will prove too expensive for mass usage, but supporters of the technology have high hopes. 
Using natural gas for heating generates about a third of the UK emissions that are driving global warming.
But the only product of burning hydrogen is water.
As a fuel, hydrogen functions in much the same way as natural gas. So staff in the university canteen say cooking on the 20% hydrogen blend has made no difference to their cooking regime.
The project – known as HyDeploy - is the UK’s first live trial of hydrogen in a modern gas network. Keele was chosen because it has a private gas system.
Its hydrogen is produced in an electrolyser - a device that splits water (H2O) into its constituents: hydrogen and oxygen. The machine is located in a glossy green shipping container in the corner of the university’s sports field.
The gas distribution firm Cadent, which is leading the project, says that if a 20% blend were to be rolled out across Britain, it would reduce emissions of CO2 by six million tonnes - equivalent to taking 2.5 million cars off the road. 
The hydrogen could be generated pollution-free by using surplus wind power at night to split water molecules using electrolysis.
The 20% proportion was chosen because it’s an optimal blend that won’t affect gas pipes and appliances.
Currently, the UK has only small supplies of hydrogen, but the firm says increasing production would offer a quick way of cutting emissions from heating.
Consultant engineer Ed Syson told BBC News: “The prize is a large one. If we were to roll this system out across the UK it would be on broadly the same scale as offshore wind is today. So it’s a significant technology.
“What’s more, it makes those carbon savings without having customers change their behaviour in any way.”
Some boiler manufacturers are already producing prototype boilers that use 100% hydrogen. 
Worcester Bosch, for instance, has a “hydrogen-ready” design. It can run on natural gas, but it’s capable of converting to 100% hydrogen following a one-hour visit by an engineer. 
The firm wants the government to stipulate that by 2025, all new boilers on sale should be hydrogen-ready.
It says this would allow households to switch painlessly to clean boilers when existing boilers reach the end of their lives. The extra cost of the hydrogen-ready boiler would be about £50, it says.
Hydrogen can be produced from water through electrolysis, or from natural gas.
Electrolysis from surplus renewable energy is unambiguously beneficial for the environment – but it’s not very efficient. 
For the foreseeable future it may be cheaper to produce hydrogen from natural gas. However, CO2 is released in the industrial process used to generate hydrogen.
The resulting CO2 would need to be captured and stored underground with carbon capture and storage (CCS) - a technology not yet established at scale.
About 85% of homes have gas central heating, and some experts believe it will prove more cost-effective to switch boilers to hydrogen, rather than to install heat pumps which would require the UK’s aging housing stock to be highly insulated.
A recent study for the government raised the possibility that homes could be warmed by a hybrid system using electric heat pumps, then topping up with hydrogen on cold days. 
Major drawbacks to hydrogen are cost and availability. The costs are much higher than for natural gas, although the differential will surely shrink as carbon taxes raise the price of burning gas to combat climate change over coming decades.
The environmental think tank E3G said in a statement: “Going for hydrogen entails massive infrastructure expenditure. In many cases the additional costs make it look unattractive compared with alternatives (like renewables). 
Richard Black from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) told BBC News: “We will and should have hydrogen in the mix of energy options, but it’s not a wonder solution to everything, which you sometimes get the impression from the rhetoric. There is hope – but too much hype.” 
Meanwhile, in the corner of a sports field in Keele, the container of hope has just supplied enough hydrogen to cook 20% of Christmas dinners.

Actor Russell Crowe has used his winner's speech at the Golden Globes to raise awareness of the deadly bushfire crisis in Australia.
""Make no mistake. The tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate change-based,"" he said in a message read out on stage by show host Jennifer Aniston.
Crowe won the award for his portrayal of Fox News Chief Executive Roger Ailes in The Loudest Voice in the Room.
His comments join a wave of celebrity support for the fire response.
At least 24 people have died since the fires began in September. 
The fires are a natural part of the Australian weather cycle, but have been worsened this year by hotter-than-average temperatures and a persistent drought in many areas.
Crowe is one of thousands of Australian residents whose homes have been lost or damaged by the bushfires, which are affecting every state and territory.
""We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is,"" he said in his message.
Crowe was not at the Golden Globes ceremony in Hollywood - Aniston said he had stayed at home to protect his family. 
He has been posting regularly on social media since the fires began, about the damage to his home but also encouraging donations to the largely volunteer fire services. 
His latest video showed his Golden Globe alongside his firefighting equipment.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who took home two award for her Fleabag series, said she would auction off her custom-made suit to raise funds.
Actress Cate Blanchett also paid tribute at the ceremony to the largely volunteer firefighting operation, saying: ""When one country is facing a climate disaster, we are all facing a climate disaster.""
And Joaquin Phoenix, who won best actor in a drama for The Joker, called on Hollywood to ""get unified and make some changes"" on climate change.
The Golden Globe speeches are part of a surge of celebrity activism over the past week, as the scale of the crisis has become more known internationally.

Scores of actors, singers and sports stars - Australian or otherwise - have donated to help the victims of the fires or are encouraging others to do so.
Australian actress Margot Robbie shared an emotional appeal on Instagram on Monday showing pictures of her childhood to show ""how beautiful our country is"".
""It is so beautiful and it's really hurting right now,"" she said, while calling for her followers to give to various charities ""to give future generations the kind of childhood I was so lucky to have"". 
Prominent Australian writers have also joined forces under the #AuthorsForFireys hashtag on Twitter, auctioning off personalised pieces of writing, workshops, illustrations or coaching in exchange for donations. 
In the sports world, Australian cricket great Shane Warne is auctioning off his famous green Test cap to raise funds for the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund.
The highest bid is currently more than A$300,000 ($209,000; £160,000).
Several tennis players taking part in the Brisbane Open have said they will give sizeable donations - or in the case of Australian world number one Ashleigh Barty all her prize money if she wins.
Donations have also been pledged by Australian actress Nicole Kidman and her husband Keith Urban, and by the singer Pink, who said on Saturday she was ""totally devastated"".
Comedian Celeste Barber, who found fame through recreating celebrity Instagram pictures, launched an appeal through her account at the weekend which has already raised more than A$31m.
She shared an image of her mother-in-law's home, saying: ""It's terrifying. They are scared."" 
 This is my mother in laws house. It’s terrifying. They are scared. They need your help. International donations can be made via the link in my bio.

Kim Kardashian-West, who has nearly 63 million followers on Twitter, tweeted a string of news articles about the fires on 3 January, followed by the message: ""Climate change is real"", while Selena Gomez, with more than 59 million followers on Twitter, also called for donations.
Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has warned that the fires could burn for months. 
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

The 10 years to the end of 2019 have been confirmed as the warmest decade on record by three global agencies.
This year, climate change has been linked to Australian bushfires, torrential rains in Indonesia and record-breaking temperatures in Europe - but just what is climate change?
The BBC's global science correspondent Rebecca Morelle explains.

** Is it wrong to be hopeful about climate change? - BBC Future **

* https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200109-is-it-wrong-to-be-hopeful-about-climate-change *


Menu
In 2018, a 30-minute documentary was premiered in San José, Costa Rica’s capital and my hometown. The film followed the early efforts of a handful of marine biologists who are fighting coral bleaching. They grow tiny bits of coral in underwater nurseries and once they’re big enough move them back to the reef, hoping to restore it.
Their pace is slow, possibly too slow to keep up with bleaching due to climate change. Warming waters swipe entire reefs in a matter of weeks. The biologists need months to nurture enough corals to restore a couple of square meters. Reef restoration seems like an impossible task, but they are relentless. It must be done to give corals a chance, so they are doing it.
It’s the same principle guiding young climate activists, atmospheric scientists and climate essayists. As author Rebecca Solnit wrote in 2016: “We don’t know what is going to happen, or how, or when, and that very uncertainty is the space of hope.”
You might also like:
In the dark movie theatre, I felt a new bond with the scientists carrying baby corals and the filmmakers chasing after them. We are, indeed, losing this battle. They understand that, I believe, but in a tropical gulf thousands of miles away from where diplomats and politicians decide our carbon policies and international accords, a group of stubborn biologists and documentarists were refusing to give up. They were earning their own hope, one coral at a time.
I think of these dogged coral reef scientists whenever I’m asked, “What gives you hope?” in the context of climate change.
It’s a question full of nuance. Weighing it up, you have to consider the slew of recent record-breaking heatwaves, but also the indomitable force of schoolchildren protesting for their futures. It acknowledges our dire situation, yet suggests there might be a way forward. As climate change awareness goes mainstream – along with the feelings of anxiousness, pain and grief that come with it – this question has quickly become code for: “Where can I find hope?”
It may be a losing battle, but taking every step possible to stop the damage of climate change is one route to hope (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty/Alamy)
The answer, coming from both the climate movement and psychology, is clear: within yourself.
Several months ago, teenage activist Greta Thunberg scolded European MPs for failing to understand this. “You can’t just sit around waiting for hope to come,” she said last February in Brussels. “Then you are acting like spoiled irresponsible children. You don’t seem to understand that hope is something that you have to earn.”
That was a new concept for me: earning hope. Years of environmental campaigns trained me to believe hope existed somewhere out there, and I only had to look for it. For instance, Al Gore’s Climate Reality tells us that 2018 gave us teenagers striking, new advances in solar panel technology and entire nations announcing divestment from fossil fuels. Meanwhile the Green New Deal is gaining traction in the US.
But Thunberg was suggesting that these developments are not cause for hope. Nothing we’ll read about online should make us hopeful, because scrolling for hope by browsing through social media from your sofa won’t cut it. I think that’s even selfish. Those achievements are the result of exhausted youths, overworked scientists and grieving activists. For each green bill presented in a legislative body, there’s an anxious, underslept staffer who needs backup. Can one hope from the sidelines?
“A lot of times, when I hear people say ‘Yeah, I'm hopeful or I'm optimistic’, they're basing their hope and their optimism on someone else's back, someone else's actions,” says climate justice essayist Mary Annaïse Heglar.
Scrolling through social media showing other people's efforts on climate breakdown can give a false sense of optimism (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty/Alamy)
Real, good, useful hope has nothing to do with positive news. Instead, it is profoundly linked with action: both ours and that of others alongside us. It’s a sentiment that resonates with me. There’s only one way to earn hope, and that’s rolling up our sleeves.
Hope, not optimism
In her book Hope in the Dark, Rebecca Solnit argues that hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It’s something restless, alive. “It is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency,” she writes.
This matches the mainstream psychological understanding of hope. Psychologists believe it emerges out of two elements: personallydetermined goals and pathways to reach them. It can be a driving force, but it has to come from within.
That’s one of the differences between hope and optimism, says Matthew Gallagher, the psychologist who literally edited the handbook on hope.
 “Optimism is a more general expectation that good things are going to happen,” he says, “even if you don’t know how they’ll happen.” Hope, meanwhile, has positive expectations about the future but is driven by our capacity to identify goals and set strategies to achieve them, he says.
There’s little reason to be optimistic about climate change. We are set to overshoot our self-imposed temperature targets and carbon emissions started creeping up again in 2018. The transformation we must undergo is unlike anything we’ve seen before. The case for climate pessimism, and why it’s useful, is actually stronger.
And for the people in the frontlines – the Arctic communities, the small-town fishermen in the Tropics and the displaced people of colour in coastal America – hope is not even on the horizon. When survival is your number one priority, the future you need to solve is today. Hope is a luxury.
Many people gain hope from seeing how the younger generations are leading the efforts in making society sustainable (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Alamy)
But we want to know everything will be OK. Ours is a techno-optimistic society where electric cars are touted as a solution. That addiction to optimism has made the climate movement increasingly distrustful of hope. “I don’t think hope is a super motivating emotion,” says Heglar, who feels environmentalism has over-relied on it. “I think anger drives you to action, but hope puts you back to sleep.”
This is something I can relate to. If I believe falling solar panel prices and new international agreements will carry the day on their own, why should I bother to cut my own carbon footprint? Heglar and others are warning against this unfounded, passive hope. “We need courage, not hope,” writes Nasa scientist Dr Kate Marvel.
Grounding hope
Despite this, the search for hope still has an extraordinary pull. Because we often use hope and optimism interchangeably, scholars have come up with another distinction that is perhaps easier for dinner-table conversations. “There are different kinds of hope, because hope is a very complicated emotion,” says Jennifer Marlon, a climate researcher at Yale.
Her team surveyed hundreds of Americans about climate change and came up with a two-type taxonomy: false and constructive hope. People who rely on false hope believe God or nature will make this problem go away, and that humanity need not take the lead. People who adopted a mindset of constructive hope, in contrast, believe that transformation must emerge from us.
Engaging with like-minded groups with a common goal is one way to build collective hope (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty)
But on climate change, automatically expecting a better world because society acts in a certain way isn’t enough. We defeated Nazism, eradicated polio and reversed the hole in the ozone layer, right? Why not climate change?
Because it’s not that simple, writes Norwegian psychologist Per Espen Stoknes. Overestimating society’s powers can be as dangerous as false hope, because we start telling Disney-like stories in the midst of a global crisis. “[We expect] Star Wars’ sixth movie, where the little bears [ewoks] show up and together we defeat the evil empire,” he says.
His antidote is healthy skepticism. Stoknes argues we should settle our hope in our values – in what we believe is right and needed. Our actions can’t be based on the expectations of a happy ending. That outcome is outside of our control. If emissions keep rising, we risk deflation and action can dry up. Our values, however, persist.
This view of grounded hope embraces the unknowns and accepts uncertainty as the natural habitat of hope. “You’re no longer dependent or addicted to optimism,” says Stoknes. “You can be pessimistic and yet full of hope.”
Hoping together
In her 2004 essay The Art of Good Hope, Princeton philosopher Victoria McGeer brushes away both wishful thinking and wilful stubborn determination. She warns that wishful hopers depend on external forces, while wilful hopers overestimate their own powers. One pathway she suggests is to balance these extremes through communities.
Our earliest lessons of hope and agency were provided by our parents, our very first clan. With them we learned that we can walk, read, ride a bicycle or swim ten feet. But learning to hope as adults in our increasingly individualistic societies requires new scaffolding, argues McGeer. It involves empowering ourselves in part through empowering others with the energy of a responsive hope. In this way, hope is a deeply social phenomenon.
 “If you’re feeling hopeless about climate change, get involved with people who are actively involved in doing things,” says McGeer.
One of the most visible groups at the moment are school strikers. Even adults are rallying around them in search of hope. Atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe was asked what gave her hope so frequently that she decided to start polling the audience at her talks with the same question. Six months and 500 responses later, the top answer was young people.
In some cases, the drive to praise youth activism might be a case of “scrolling for hope”, which comes with the risk of falling back into passivity. But Hayhoe believes those already engaged see youths as fellow comrades, not as others to lay the burden onto.
“When you see a new voice enter the arena you don’t put down your sword. “You say: ‘Oh, my goodness, there’s a little bit of help’,” says Hayhoe. Those already engaged are not leaving the burden to the kids, they're “redoubling their efforts because of the children.”
Genuine, grounded hope comes from rolling up one's sleeves, rather than watching other people do the work (Credit: Javier Hirschfeld/Getty)
Personally, I would not call myself hopeful. “There’s so much science and so little will,” read my final dispatch from my first climate conference, six years ago. Not much has improved since 2013. Writing about the climate crisis often seems futile. I’m guessing the same goes for forest firefighters, flood planners at coastal cities and progressive lawmakers.
But after reading and talking about hope for months, I have a different view. Hope hurts, and feels at times pointless, yet we have to keep doing it. It’s the only way. “Hope is meaning-focused coping,” says Maria Ojala, senior lecturer in psychology at Örebro University in Sweden who did her PhD in how hope and doubt permeate kids’ environmentalism. She believes positive and negative emotions about climate change are not mutually exclusive. “It’s ‘and’ instead of ‘or’,” says Ojala.
No individual will bend the emissions curve alone. No writer, modelling team, no forest firefighter, no environmental lawyer will carry the day. But if you’re looking for hope, there might be a space in constructing something together – in responsive hope. No single coral restoration programme will heal the wounds inflicted on reefs around the world, but perhaps networks offer a way forward. That collective goal, and the space of uncertainty in that “perhaps”, is our hope.

Australia's summers have become twice as long as its winters amid increasing temperatures driven by climate change, according to new weather data analysis.
The Australia Institute found that summer across most of the country over the past 20 years was about a month longer than in the mid-20th century, while winters had become shorter. 
Between 2014 and 2018, summers were found to be about 50% longer.
The findings followed Australia's warmest and driest year on record.
""Our findings are not a projection of what we may see in the future. Its happening right now,"" the Australia Institute's Richie Merzian said.
The country experienced a devastating bushfire season, which killed 33 people and an estimated one billion native animals. 
While scientists said climate change was not the direct cause of the bushfires, they have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's fires becoming more frequent and more intense.
In its analysis, the Australia Institute think tank compared official Bureau of Meteorology data from 1999 to 2018 with mid-20th century benchmarks.
It found that summer temperatures had lasted 31 days longer than in the 1950s and 1960s, while winter was about 23 days shorter.
It noted that some areas, such as the town of Port Macquarie in New South Wales, were experiencing even more drastic changes to the length of seasons, with seven more weeks of traditional summer temperatures than in the 1950s and 1960s.
""Summers have grown longer even in recent years, with the last five years facing summers twice as long as their winters,"" Mr Merzian said.
""Temperatures which were considered a regular three-month summer in the 1950s, now span from early to mid-November all the way to mid-March.""
Mr Merzian said global warming had made Australian summers ""a more dangerous ordeal"" than they used to be.
Australia's government faced scrutiny over its climate policies during the devastating bushfire season, with critics accusing Prime Minister Scott Morrison of inaction.
Australia is one of the highest emitters of carbon pollution per capita, largely because it is still heavily reliant on coal-fired power.
Mr Morrison has insisted that Australia is meeting the challenge ""better than most countries"" and fulfilling international targets.
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

Breakthrough technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen cannot be relied on to help the UK meet its climate change targets, a report says.
The government had hoped that both technologies would contribute to emissions reductions required by 2050.
But the report’s authors say ministers should assume that neither carbon capture and storage (CCS) nor hydrogen will be running ""at scale"" by 2050.
They say the government must start a debate on other, controversial steps.
These actions, which they say would need to be implemented in the near-term, include cutting down on flying and eating red meat.
UK law dictates that, by 2050, carbon emissions will be virtually halted, and any remaining emissions will have to be compensated for by activities such as tree planting.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has regularly expressed the belief that technology would mostly solve the problem.
But the authors say that if new tech does emerge at scale by 2050, the government should treat it as a bonus, not an expectation.
Both of the new technologies in question have their supporters in politics and in industry.
Hydrogen technology entails generating hydrogen from natural gas, or from water. 
CCS entails capturing CO2 emissions from power stations or industry, and burying them in rock formations or finding uses for the CO2. Both are expensive.
A few years ago, government economists predicted that gas plants equipped with CCS would be producing 30% of the UK’s clean electricity in the future. Nuclear and renewables would produce another 30% each.
Tom Burke, an expert on climate change, forecast at that time that only CCS could save the climate. When I reminded him yesterday, he admitted: “I was wrong”.
The equation radically changed because the nuclear renaissance didn’t happen; the government pulled funding from CCS projects; and the cost of renewables plummeted. 
The government has now offered new CCS funds - but for tackling carbon emissions from industrial clusters, rather than from power generation. 
The new technology report comes from a government-funded consortium of academics from Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and Imperial College London.
It’s being debated in the Lords on Thursday. The debate’s sponsor, Baron Browne of Ladyton, said it carries important messages that should be heard. 
The report says: “Businesses and the public want to act to eliminate emissions, but exaggerated claims about the speed at which new technologies can be introduced are holding back progress.""
It continued: “Relying on breakthrough technologies to achieve zero emissions by 2050 is risky and delays action. 
“Instead, with today’s technologies we can meet the target for almost all activities, but we have no substitutes for cement, shipping, flying, lamb or beef.” 
The report says the UK can anticipate having four times as much emissions-free electricity in 2050 as today if current rates of renewables expansion continue. 
This, it says, is enough to supply 60% of today’s energy-using activities, if they are electrified. 
It says to close the remaining energy gap, we could make incremental changes to the way we use technologies - such as buying smaller cars rather than SUVs.
Another option is to take the train instead of the car, or put more passengers in fewer cars (ride sharing).
Yet another possibility is to only heat rooms where people are sitting, and swap gas boilers for heat pumps when they need to be changed. 
The government, the report says, should start a debate on these issues.
It says the two outstandingly difficult areas to de-carbonise are shipping and cement manufacture.
Julian Allwood, lead author and professor of engineering and the environment at Cambridge University, told BBC News: ""The problem with delivering climate mitigation is the tension between the government wanting to deliver solutions based on technology and protestors and scientists asking for fast action that bites much more rapidly than we can bring new technologies into place. 
""So although new technologies may become relevant by 2100, the number operating at scale in 2050 will be very few. Probably we’ve got to deliver on climate change with today’s technologies.""
The message contradicts several comments from the Prime Minister putting faith in technology to deliver 2050 targets. Recently, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said no one needed to fly less, and that technology would solve the problem.
The government has committed to having CCS in industrial clusters from the second half of the 2020s and CCS at scale by 2030.
The net zero scenario from the Committee on Climate Change includes 75-175 Megatonnes (Mt) of CO2 being captured and stored per year by 2050.
The report's authors say it typically takes 30 years for a major new technology such as carbon capture to solve all its complexities, including legal and safety implications; and public concerns, before it begins to be widely adopted. 
But this will be too late to hit the government's 2050 targets.
A government spokesperson said: ""Achieving net zero by 2050 requires decisive action across the economy, including developing a range of approaches and technologies. 
""Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS), for example, can play an essential role as part of a balanced approach. Our ambition is to be a world leader in this technology.""

Human life ""as we know it"" could be threatened by climate change, economists at JP Morgan have warned.
In a hard-hitting report to clients, the economists said that without action being taken there could be ""catastrophic outcomes"".
The bank said the research came from a team that was ""wholly independent from the company as a whole"".
Climate campaigners have previously criticised JP Morgan for its investments in fossil fuels.
The firm's stark report was sent to clients and seen by BBC News.
While JP Morgan economists have warned about unpredictability in climate change before, the language used in the new report was very forceful.
""We cannot rule out catastrophic outcomes where human life as we know it is threatened,"" JP Morgan economists David Mackie and Jessica Murray said.
Carbon emissions in the coming decades ""will continue to affect the climate for centuries to come in a way that is likely to be irreversible,"" they said, adding that climate change action should be motivated ""by the likelihood of extreme events"".
Climate change could affect economic growth, shares, health, and how long people live, they said.
It could put stresses on water, cause famine, and cause people to be displaced or migrate. Climate change could also cause political stress, conflict, and it could hit biodiversity and species survival, the report warned. 
To mitigate climate change net carbon emissions need to be cut to zero by 2050. To do this, there needed to be a global tax on carbon, the report authors said.
But they said that ""this is not going to happen anytime soon"".
Developed countries were worried that cutting emissions would affect competitiveness and jobs, while less developed countries ""see carbon intensive activity as a way of raising living standards.""
""It is a global problem but no global solution is in sight,"" the report added.
The bank has warned about climate change before, although not in such strong and sweeping terms as its economists.
In March 2019 Bloomberg reported that an executive had warned that the US needed to significantly cut its carbon footprint, and in May of that year iJP Morgan called climate change a ""global challenge"" that presents risks for business.
Large organisations such as JP Morgan face a challenge in that inaction on climate change could have a huge hit on revenues - but so could taking action.
JP Morgan itself has been strongly criticised in the past for heavy investment in fossil fuels.
The Rainforest Action Network released a 2019 report claiming that the US banking giant provided the most fossil fuel firm financing of any bank in from 2016 to 2018.
Rupert Read, an associate professor of philosophy at the University of East Anglia, and a spokesperson for campaign group Extinction Rebellion, said that the bank is ""taken by some to be the largest fossil fuel funder in the world.""
He said if the bank's own researchers were ""saying the very future of the human race is at stake"" then the bank itself should change its direction.
""It's good they [the researchers] are telling the truth more - it's not good they [the bank] remain a strong funder of fossil fuels,"" he said.
""Everyone has to have responsibility for change, whether they are asset managers, or institutional investors, or chief executives, or shareholders,"" he added.
A JP Morgan spokesperson said the research team's view was ""wholly independent from the company as a whole, and not a commentary on it"" and declined to comment further.
Mark Cutifani, chief executive of mining giant Anglo American, told the BBC how the firm wants to reduce its carbon footprint, and ''can see a pathway to creating carbon neutral mines''. 
Talking about a timeframe he added: ""We are a bit concerned about putting a date on it as yet because some of the technologies are still evolving. We will get there, the only question is how quickly we can get there.'' 
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

""It's educated people who are causing the most damage to the planet,"" says sixth-former Joe Brindle. 
Joe, 17, says schools need to put the environment at the heart of education. 
Ministers agree ""it is vital that pupils are taught about climate change"" but Joe says schools are failing to prepare them for a climate emergency.
He is a founder member of Teach the Future which next week takes its call for an environmental overhaul of education to Parliament.  
""It's people with degrees from Oxford and Cambridge who are becoming fossil-fuel chief executives and they are the ones who are causing the most destruction to our world,"" says Joe. 
""And therefore that kind of shows that education is not succeeding and that our education is broken because education should be creating better people not worse."" 
On Wednesday, Joe, a pupil at Devizes School, and more than a dozen other under-18s who make up the core of Teach the Future, will take over Parliament's Terrace Pavilion to host a crowdfunded reception for MPs. 
The group, run jointly by the UK Student Climate Network, best known for the school climate strikes, and the National Union of Students' climate charity offshoot, SOS-UK, is launching a draft English emergency education bill which embodies their key demands and which Joe believes ""is going to be really big"". 
Teach the Future is hoping the draft could at some stage form the basis of a private member's bill but for now, the aim is ""to get MPs on our side"". 
The idea is based on the 1958 US National Defense Education Act which aimed to kickstart engineering, maths and science education and give America the edge in the space and arms races. 
It paid off - by July 1969, the average age in Apollo mission control was just 28. 
""I think it really shows that education can be used to solve a difficult problem, if the focus is down from the government,"" says Joe, who will sit A-levels in history, biology and chemistry this summer. 
But rather than focusing exclusively on science, technology, engineering and maths - the range of the climate emergency education act needs to be far wider, he believes. 
""The space race was just one thing but the climate crisis affects every single part of everything and it requires solutions from every single part of society, whether it be arts, whether it be maths, whether it be sciences."" 
He wants everyone to understand the impact of their behaviour on the environment and ""try to do things in a way that has as little negative impact as you can"". 
And while engineers have an important role, fundamentally, education needs to become more sustainable, he says. 
People need to understand how the climate crisis happened, he argues: ""It's a symptom of a general unsustainable system.""
Joe believes most people his age ""want to understand more about climate change and what's behind it, the issues of justice... and the politics behind it"". 
But he says that while schools are largely sympathetic, they are constrained by limited budgets and the demands of a high-stakes exam system - and often teachers themselves lack detailed knowledge about climate change.  
""It's not good enough that sustainability is restricted to a few subjects and most of our teachers and lecturers don't know enough about it,"" say the campaigners. 
They also point out that including climate change in the national curriculum will only affect local authority schools - not academies, free schools or the private sector. 
The group has invited dozens of MPs to the reception and are ""particularly hoping government ministers and people close to the government will be there"".
Teach the Future's wish-list also includes having climate science and sustainability included in teacher training and all education buildings to have a net-zero carbon footprint by 2030. 
The group was founded in autumn 2019 but already has support from leading education unions and environmental organisations. It is hoping that several dozen MPs will attend the reception. 
In a statement, the government said: ""It is vital that pupils are taught about climate change, which is why topics are included across the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools. Teachers have the freedom to expand on these areas if they wish.
""This government is a world leader in tackling climate change and we are the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. The Department for Education provides funding to support schools to become more sustainable institutions.""
A spokesperson said topics related to climate change and sustainability were included in the national curriculum for science and geography, a new environmental science A-level was introduced in 2017 and sustainability will be included in some new T-level technical qualifications, for example, construction students will learn about renewable energy and energy-efficiency technologies. 
The Department for Education also supports energy efficiency through its capital funding programmes, including interest-free loans, the spokesperson added.

New rules could spell the death of a ""throwaway"" culture in which products are bought, used briefly, then binned.
The regulations will apply to a range of everyday items such as mobile phones, textiles, electronics, batteries, construction and packaging.
They will ensure products are designed and manufactured so they last - and so they're repairable if they go wrong. 
It should mean that your phone lasts longer and proves easier to fix.
That may be especially true if the display or the battery needs changing. 
It's part of a worldwide movement called the Right to Repair, which has spawned citizens' repair workshops in several UK cities.
The plan is being presented by the European Commission. It's likely to create standards for the UK, too - even after Brexit.
That's because it probably won't be worthwhile for manufacturers to make lower-grade models that can only be sold in Britain.
It's all part of what one green group is calling the most ambitious and comprehensive proposal ever put forward to reduce the environmental and climate impact of the things we use and wear.
Proposals aim at making environmentally-friendly products the norm. It could mean manufacturers using screws to hold parts in place, rather than glue.
The rules will also fight what is known as ""premature obsolescence"", the syndrome in which manufacturers make goods with deliberately low lifespan to force consumers into buying a newer model.
One green group, the European Environment Bureau (EEB), said: ""The strategy is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the way we manufacture, use and dispose of our products in a way that benefits people and the planet.""
It urges Europe's politicians to turn the plans into reality. 
The EU also wants to set a food waste reduction target, end over-packaging, and curb microplastic pollution. Other recommendations under the proposals, known as the Circular Economy Action Plan, are:
The idea is to encourage manufacturers to make sure things don't break - because they'll have to pick up the bill for repair or replacement.
The new rules take a step further than previous narrower regulations aimed at securing the repair-ability of ""white goods"" such as fridges and washing machines.  
But the EEB complains that the package should go even further by setting waste prevention targets for businesses and industries, and setting goals for reducing resource use overall across Europe.
The new EU package may restore some of the block's reputation for environmental leadership following condemnation of last week's climate package. 
Certainly the tone of the document strikes a green note. It begins: ""There is only one planet Earth, yet by 2050, the world will be consuming as if there were three."" 
It notes: ""Many products break down too quickly, cannot be easily reused, repaired or recycled, and many are made for single-use only.""
The report says global consumption of materials such as biomass (plant material), fossil fuels, metals and minerals is expected to double in the next 40 years.
And it says half of total greenhouse gas emissions and more than 90% of biodiversity loss and water stress come from resource extraction and processing.
The measures will need to be agreed by member states and MEPs. But they are likely to be under pressure to act from their own citizens who don't appear to appreciate the throwaway society.

The rich are primarily to blame for the global climate crisis, a study by the University of Leeds of 86 countries claims.
The wealthiest tenth of people consume about 20 times more energy overall than the bottom ten, wherever they live.
The gulf is greatest in transport, where the top tenth gobble 187 times more fuel than the poorest tenth, the research says.
That’s because people on the lowest incomes can rarely afford to drive.
The researchers found that the richer people became, the more energy they typically use. And it was replicated across all countries. 
And they warn that, unless there's a significant policy change, household energy consumption could double from 2011 levels by 2050. That's even if energy efficiency improves.
Transport gulf
The researchers combined European Union and World Bank data to calculate how different income groups spend their money. They say it’s the first study of its kind.
It found that  in transport the richest tenth of consumers use more than half the energy. This reflects previous research showing that 15% of UK travellers take 70% of all flights.
The ultra-rich fly by far furthest, while 57% of the UK population does not fly abroad at all.
The study, published in Nature Energy, showed that energy for cooking and heating is more equitably consumed. 
But even then, the top 10% of consumers used roughly one third of the total, presumably reflecting the size of their homes.
Solutions?
Co-author Professor Julia Steinberger, leader of the  project at Leeds, asked: “How can we change the vastly unequal distribution of energy to provide a decent life for everyone while protecting the climate and ecosystems?”
The authors say governments could reduce transport demand through better public transport, higher taxes on bigger vehicles and frequent flyer levies for people who take most holidays.
They say another alternative is to electrify vehicles more quickly, although previous studies suggest even then demand for driving must be reduced in order to reduce the strain on resource use and electricity production and distribution.
Rich Brits
The research also examined the relative energy consumption of one nation against another.
It shows that a fifth of UK citizens are in the top 5% of global energy consumers, along with 40% of German citizens, and Luxembourg’s entire population.
Only 2% of Chinese people are in the top global 5% of users, and just 0.02% of people in India.
Even the poorest fifth of Britons consumes over five times as much energy per person as the bottom billion in India.
The study is likely to ignite future UN climate negotiations, where the issue of equity is always bitterly contentious. 
In the USA, libertarian politicians have typically portrayed climate change as a harbinger of global socialism.
Normal lives?
But Professor Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre in Manchester, who was not involved in the study, told BBC News: “This study tells relatively wealthy people like us what we don’t want to hear.
“The climate issue is framed by us high emitters – the politicians, business people, journalists, academics. When we say there’s no appetite for higher taxes on flying, we mean WE don’t want to fly less
“The same is true about our cars and the size our homes. We have convinced ourselves that our lives are normal, yet the numbers tell a very different story,” he said.
The study says transport energy alone could increase 31% by 2050. “If transport continues to rely on fossil fuels, this increase would be disastrous for the climate,” the report says.
It suggests different remedies for different types of energy use. So, flying and driving big cars could face higher taxes, while energy from homes could be reduced by a housing retrofit.
The authors note that the recent Budget declined to increase fuel duty and promised 4,000 miles of new roads. It did not mention home insulation.
The Treasury was contacted to discuss the taxation issues raised in the research, but declined to comment.

Mongolia's vast grasslands cover about three-quarters of the country, where nomadic herdsmen have maintained traditions stretching back centuries. But this world is changing - fast.
About 70% of this once verdant land has now been damaged, mostly due to overgrazing. The main culprit is the country's estimated 27 million cashmere goats, which are farmed for their highly-prized wool.
Unlike the country's 31 million sheep, the goats dig out and eat the roots of the grass, making re-growth much harder.
Add climate change on top, and the United Nations warns that a quarter of Mongolia's grasslands have now turned to desert. The nation is, in fact, particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures, with a 2C increase over the past 70 years, higher than the world average.
""When I was child, I vividly remember the grasses would grow taller, and we would receive more rain,"" says Batmunkh, a herder in the Dornod province. He looks after 1,000 animals, 300 of which are cashmere goats.
The dilemma for Mongolia is that with global demand for cashmere continuing to rise strongly, how can the country earn more money from selling it, at the same time as reducing the industry's environmental impact?
Since Mongolia's peaceful transition from communism to democracy in 1990, the number of goats in the country have soared. Between 1999 and 2019 numbers increased almost fourfold from seven million to today's 27 million.
They are looked after by 1.2 million nomadic herders, some 40% of the country's population.
Once a rare luxury, fashion items made from cashmere are now readily available from most High Street and online fashion retailers in the UK, US and other developed countries. With global prices having risen more than 60% since the 1980s, the world cashmere clothing market was valued at $2.5bn (£2bn) in 2018, according to a UN development programme report. This is projected to reach $3.5bn by the end of 2025.
Mongolia is the world's second-largest producer of raw cashmere after China, accounting for approximately a fifth of global supply. It is the country's third-largest export after copper and gold, and the total amount produced has risen sharply in recent years.
But while the country's cashmere is considered by many people to be the highest quality, much of it ends up in China where it is blended with Chinese wool. For a jumper, about four goats are needed, and last year's average price was 130,000 Mongolian tugriks ($47; £36) per kilo.
""It is very unfortunate that our own cashmere cannot be proudly sold on a global market as Mongolian cashmere,"" says  Batmunkh. ""Whatever we produce is being mixed up in China with other cashmere.""
About 90% of Mongolian raw cashmere production is currently sold to Chinese brokers, who usually sell on to Chinese-owned processing companies in Mongolia, says Zara Morris-Trainor, an associate consultant at the Sustainable Fibre Alliance. The organisation works with brands such as Burberry, J Crew and M&S. 
These Chinese processing companies typically wash and scour the raw cashmere, before exporting it to China for further processing and production of garments. 
The hope of both the Mongolian government and the UN is that overgrazing can be reduced, and prices increased, by two initiatives. The first is by introducing a new system of traceability, and the second is by opening more plants in Ulaanbaatar that can do the entire processing work, so that the finished wool can be sold for a ""made in Mongolia"" premium.
To better ensure traceability, Batmunkh is now involved in a pilot initiative that uses blockchain technology - made famous as the tech behind the cryptocurrency bitcoin - to follow cashmere from the goats to new processing facilities in the capital, Ulaanbaatar.
Herders use a mobile phone app to register cashmere bales and attach a tracking tag.
The app was created by Toronto-based Convergence Tech, which is working with the UN in three provinces in north-east Mongolia. The idea is to limit production from overgrazed areas.
Chami Akmeemana, the firm's chief executive, hopes it will provide traceability and authenticity. ""There is very little transparency at present because of the chaos of the raw materials market, which is clouded by middlemen and market aggregators,"" he says.
More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:
However, Dr Troy Sternberg, an expert on Mongolia at Oxford University's School of Geography and the Environment, urges caution. He says that the tagging does not cover the whole supply, but typically only up to the first processing facility. Nor does he rule out people just removing tags and relabeling the cashmere.
He says it would be helpful if the big fashion brands got behind promoting more environmentally friendly cashmere.
""It'll be a challenge to roll out the tags over such a vast country,"" says Dr Sternberg. ""But if brands worked harder to establish a Mongolian quality cashmere, like coffee sourcing in Colombia, that could really impact the herders and the grasslands.""  
Regarding building more cashmere processing plants in Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry is now working with private sector partners.
Batmunkh is hoping that the two initiatives will be successful, despite the background problem of climate change.
""I do find the climate changing,"" he says. ""And as nomads we heavily depend on nature.""
The current lack of grass means that he has to buy more fodder for his goats, and overall he remains fearful for the long term future of the industry in Mongolia. The hotter weather also means that the goats produce wool of a lesser quality, as they grow fewer of the tightly packed fine fibres needed for them to keep warm during the winter months.
""I try to send all my kids to school with the money I make from selling cashmere,"" he says, which would give them another route. 
""I am quite torn to think that our knowledge and heritage from our ancestors will die with us. On the other hand, I don't want to leave my children to risks and uncertainties.""
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.

Australia's summers have become twice as long as its winters amid increasing temperatures driven by climate change, according to new weather data analysis.
The Australia Institute found that summer across most of the country over the past 20 years was about a month longer than in the mid-20th century, while winters had become shorter. 
Between 2014 and 2018, summers were found to be about 50% longer.
The findings followed Australia's warmest and driest year on record.
""Our findings are not a projection of what we may see in the future. Its happening right now,"" the Australia Institute's Richie Merzian said.
The country experienced a devastating bushfire season, which killed 33 people and an estimated one billion native animals. 
While scientists said climate change was not the direct cause of the bushfires, they have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's fires becoming more frequent and more intense.
In its analysis, the Australia Institute think tank compared official Bureau of Meteorology data from 1999 to 2018 with mid-20th century benchmarks.
It found that summer temperatures had lasted 31 days longer than in the 1950s and 1960s, while winter was about 23 days shorter.
It noted that some areas, such as the town of Port Macquarie in New South Wales, were experiencing even more drastic changes to the length of seasons, with seven more weeks of traditional summer temperatures than in the 1950s and 1960s.
""Summers have grown longer even in recent years, with the last five years facing summers twice as long as their winters,"" Mr Merzian said.
""Temperatures which were considered a regular three-month summer in the 1950s, now span from early to mid-November all the way to mid-March.""
Mr Merzian said global warming had made Australian summers ""a more dangerous ordeal"" than they used to be.
Australia's government faced scrutiny over its climate policies during the devastating bushfire season, with critics accusing Prime Minister Scott Morrison of inaction.
Australia is one of the highest emitters of carbon pollution per capita, largely because it is still heavily reliant on coal-fired power.
Mr Morrison has insisted that Australia is meeting the challenge ""better than most countries"" and fulfilling international targets.
The latest figures add another 737 people on to the nationwide toll of hospital deaths.
