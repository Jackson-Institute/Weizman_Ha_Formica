Al Jazeera's Heidi Zhou-Castro brings us to two US communities that will soon cease to exist.
On opposite coasts of the United States, two towns are facing a big problem - they are eroding and sinking. Neither community denies climate change's effects on their vanishing shorelines. But they have very different ideas about how to save their land.
In this episode, Heidi Zhou-Castro, Al Jazeera English journalist covering the US, takes us to the two communities that will soon cease to exist.
