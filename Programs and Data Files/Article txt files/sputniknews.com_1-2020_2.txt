Scientists have linked climate change to global daily weather patterns for the first time in a new study published Thursday in the journal Nature Climate Change. 

According to the study, climate scientists have generally touted that “weather is not climate” and that climate change is instead the “change in the distribution of weather” over decades. 
The researchers also found that global temperatures and humidity are affected by human factors and not just random variability, and that long-term climate change trends can be predicted from global average temperatures.
“Global mean temperature on a single day is already quite a bit shifted. You can see this human fingerprint in any single moment,” he added, also noting,  “Weather is climate change if you look over the whole globe.”
“This . . . is telling us that anthropogenic climate change has become so large that it exceeds even daily weather variability at the global scale,” Wehner told the Washington Post. “This is disturbing as the Earth is on track for significantly more warming in even the most optimistic future scenarios.”
