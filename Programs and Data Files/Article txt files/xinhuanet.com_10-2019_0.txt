UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- An African Union (AU) envoy on Wednesday said the regional group and the United Nations need to enhance efforts to address climate change.
Fatima Kyari Mohammed, AU permanent observer to the United Nations, pointed to the increasing need to enhance the two bodies' joint regional approaches to climate security, especially for the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and other affected areas.
She noted the impacts of climate change are exacerbating existing tensions across these regions, as can be seen in the increase of inter-communal tensions and clashes in various parts of the continent.
While the AU has deployed various efforts towards timely response in disaster situations, she said, joint preventive efforts should also be considered.
Mohammed made the remarks at a Security Council meeting on the UN-AU partnership.
She further said the two bodies should step up cooperation in peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction, while recognizing progress made in efforts to prevent and manage conflicts.
The United Nations has recently highlighted the serious flooding in Somalia, a Horn of African country, where over 180,000 people were estimated to have been displaced. Farmland, infrastructure and roads were destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit areas.
